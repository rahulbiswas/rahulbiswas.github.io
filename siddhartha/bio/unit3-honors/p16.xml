    <question>
        <text>Which process allows plants to adapt to changing light conditions?</text>
        <option>Closing all stomata permanently</option>
        <option>State transitions of photosystem proteins</option>
        <option>Stopping the Calvin cycle</option>
        <option>Increasing photorespiration</option>
        <answer>State transitions of photosystem proteins</answer>
        <explanation>Plants can adjust the distribution of light-harvesting complexes between photosystems I and II through state transitions, optimizing light capture and energy distribution as light conditions change.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>How do plants protect themselves from excess light energy?</text>
        <option>By increasing photosynthesis indefinitely</option>
        <option>Through the xanthophyll cycle and heat dissipation</option>
        <option>By stopping all electron transport</option>
        <option>Through increased water uptake</option>
        <answer>Through the xanthophyll cycle and heat dissipation</answer>
        <explanation>Plants use the xanthophyll cycle to safely dissipate excess light energy as heat, preventing damage to photosynthetic machinery. This non-photochemical quenching helps protect against photodamage.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>What role do plant antenna complexes serve?</text>
        <option>They directly split water molecules</option>
        <option>They collect and transfer light energy to reaction centers</option>
        <option>They produce ATP independently</option>
        <option>They fix carbon dioxide</option>
        <answer>They collect and transfer light energy to reaction centers</answer>
        <explanation>Antenna complexes contain multiple pigment molecules that absorb light energy and transfer it to reaction center chlorophyll, increasing the efficiency of light capture for photosynthesis.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>How does cyclic electron flow benefit plants?</text>
        <option>It produces more NADPH</option>
        <option>It generates ATP without producing NADPH</option>
        <option>It fixes more carbon dioxide</option>
        <option>It increases water splitting</option>
        <answer>It generates ATP without producing NADPH</answer>
        <explanation>Cyclic electron flow allows plants to generate additional ATP without producing NADPH, helping balance the ATP:NADPH ratio needed for carbon fixation and other cellular processes.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>What happens to chloroplast orientation during high light stress?</text>
        <option>They remain stationary</option>
        <option>They move to maximize light exposure</option>
        <option>They move to minimize light exposure</option>
        <option>They exit the cell</option>
        <answer>They move to minimize light exposure</answer>
        <explanation>Under high light stress, chloroplasts undergo the avoidance response, moving to the cell sides to minimize light absorption and prevent photodamage. This demonstrates cellular-level adaptation to light stress.</explanation>
