    <question>
        <text>How do Arctic organisms adapt their metabolism for extreme cold?</text>
        <option>They stop all metabolism</option>
        <option>They modify membrane composition and enzyme function</option>
        <option>They only use anaerobic processes</option>
        <option>They increase body temperature</option>
        <answer>They modify membrane composition and enzyme function</answer>
        <explanation>Arctic organisms adapt to extreme cold by modifying membrane lipid composition for maintained fluidity and producing cold-adapted enzymes that function efficiently at low temperatures.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>What metabolic adaptations allow for winter survival?</text>
        <option>Complete metabolic shutdown</option>
        <option>Production of antifreeze compounds and energy reserves</option>
        <option>Increased metabolic rate</option>
        <option>Normal metabolism continues</option>
        <answer>Production of antifreeze compounds and energy reserves</answer>
        <explanation>Arctic organisms survive winter by producing antifreeze compounds, accumulating energy reserves, and adjusting metabolic pathways to maintain essential functions at low temperatures.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>How do Arctic plants optimize photosynthesis during short days?</text>
        <option>They don't photosynthesize in winter</option>
        <option>They enhance light capture and utilization efficiency</option>
        <option>They use only respiration</option>
        <option>They grow normally</option>
        <answer>They enhance light capture and utilization efficiency</answer>
        <explanation>Arctic plants optimize photosynthesis during short days by increasing chlorophyll content, modifying leaf orientation, and enhancing light-harvesting efficiency to maximize energy capture.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>What role does brown fat play in cold adaptation?</text>
        <option>It stores energy only</option>
        <option>It generates heat through uncoupled respiration</option>
        <option>It has no special function</option>
        <option>It reduces metabolism</option>
        <answer>It generates heat through uncoupled respiration</answer>
        <explanation>Brown fat generates heat through uncoupled respiratory chains, where energy from electron transport is released as heat rather than stored as ATP, helping maintain body temperature.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>How do Arctic marine organisms maintain energy balance?</text>
        <option>They hibernate completely</option>
        <option>They adjust metabolic rates and energy allocation</option>
        <option>They migrate to warmer waters</option>
        <option>They stop eating</option>
        <answer>They adjust metabolic rates and energy allocation</answer>
        <explanation>Arctic marine organisms maintain energy balance by adjusting metabolic rates, efficiently allocating energy resources, and often accumulating lipid reserves for periods of reduced food availability.</explanation>
