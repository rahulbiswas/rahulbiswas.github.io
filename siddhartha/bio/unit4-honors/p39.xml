    <question>
        <text>How do oxidative stress affect metabolism?</text>
        <option>It has no effect</option>
        <option>It disrupts normal metabolic functions</option>
        <option>It improves metabolism</option>
        <option>It only affects storage</option>
        <answer>It disrupts normal metabolic functions</answer>
        <explanation>Oxidative stress can damage cellular components and disrupt normal metabolic functions, requiring adaptive responses to maintain homeostasis.</explanation>
