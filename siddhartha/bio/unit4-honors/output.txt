        <text>How do circadian rhythms affect metabolism?</text>
        <option>They have no effect</option>
        <option>They coordinate daily metabolic changes</option>
        <option>They only affect sleep</option>
        <option>They reduce metabolism</option>
        <answer>They coordinate daily metabolic changes</answer>
        <explanation>Circadian rhythms coordinate daily metabolic changes, influencing enzyme activities, hormone levels, and nutrient utilization patterns.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>What role does AMPK play in metabolism?</text>
        <option>It stores energy</option>
        <option>It senses and responds to energy status</option>
        <option>It produces glucose</option>
        <option>It breaks down proteins</option>
        <answer>It senses and responds to energy status</answer>
        <explanation>AMPK acts as an energy sensor, activating energy-producing pathways and inhibiting energy-consuming processes when cellular energy is low.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>How do metabolic sensors regulate pathways?</text>
        <option>They don't regulate anything</option>
        <option>They detect and respond to metabolic changes</option>
        <option>They only store energy</option>
        <option>They transport molecules</option>
        <answer>They detect and respond to metabolic changes</answer>
        <explanation>Metabolic sensors detect changes in nutrient levels and energy status, triggering appropriate regulatory responses to maintain homeostasis.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>What is metabolic plasticity?</text>
        <option>Rigid metabolism</option>
        <option>Ability to adapt to metabolic changes</option>
        <option>Energy storage</option>
        <option>Protein synthesis</option>
        <answer>Ability to adapt to metabolic changes</answer>
        <explanation>Metabolic plasticity is the ability of cells to adapt their metabolic pathways in response to changing environmental conditions and cellular needs.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>How do hormones coordinate metabolism?</text>
        <option>They don't affect metabolism</option>
        <option>They signal between tissues to regulate metabolism</option>
        <option>They only store energy</option>
        <option>They break down nutrients</option>
        <answer>They signal between tissues to regulate metabolism</answer>
        <explanation>Hormones act as signaling molecules between tissues, coordinating metabolic activities throughout the body to maintain overall homeostasis.</explanation>
