    <question>
        <text>What is the function of methylases in bacteria?</text>
        <option>Repair DNA</option>
        <option>Protect from restriction enzymes</option>
        <option>Synthesize proteins</option>
        <option>Process RNA</option>
        <answer>Protect from restriction enzymes</answer>
        <explanation>Bacterial methylases add methyl groups to DNA to protect it from destruction by the cell's own restriction enzymes.</explanation>
