        <text>What is the role of TET enzymes?</text>
        <option>Add methylation</option>
        <option>Remove DNA methylation</option>
        <option>Process RNA</option>
        <option>Modify histones</option>
        <answer>Remove DNA methylation</answer>
        <explanation>TET enzymes oxidize methylated DNA bases, leading to DNA demethylation through active or passive mechanisms.</explanation>
