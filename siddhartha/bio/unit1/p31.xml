        <text>How do membrane proteins respond to stress?</text>
        <option>They always denature</option>
        <option>They adapt through various mechanisms</option>
        <option>They remain unchanged</option>
        <option>They leave the membrane</option>
        <answer>They adapt through various mechanisms</answer>
        <explanation>Membrane proteins can adapt to stress through conformational changes, interactions with chaperones, and other protective mechanisms.</explanation>
