        <text>How do symporters function?</text>
        <option>Transport one molecule</option>
        <option>Transport molecules in opposite directions</option>
        <option>Transport molecules in same direction</option>
        <option>Block transport</option>
        <answer>Transport molecules in same direction</answer>
        <explanation>Symporters transport two different molecules across a membrane in the same direction simultaneously.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>What determines ion selectivity in channels?</text>
        <option>Only size</option>
        <option>Only charge</option>
        <option>Selectivity filter properties</option>
        <option>Random selection</option>
        <answer>Selectivity filter properties</answer>
        <explanation>Ion channels use specific selectivity filters that discriminate ions based on size, charge, and hydration properties.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>How do antiporters differ from symporters?</text>
        <option>They use more energy</option>
        <option>They transport in opposite directions</option>
        <option>They transport only one molecule</option>
        <option>They don't use energy</option>
        <answer>They transport in opposite directions</answer>
        <explanation>Antiporters transport two different molecules across a membrane in opposite directions simultaneously.</explanation>
