Ne oppa! The Rural Electrification Administration was like bringing K-drama level changes to farm life! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Before the REA in 1935, only about 10% of rural American homes had electricity - imagine trying to run a farm without power! (어려워요!) Private companies didn't want to string electric lines to far-apart farms because they said it wasn't profitable. So the REA helped farmers form cooperatives and gave them loans to build their own electric systems!

The changes were amazing:
- Electric pumps for water instead of hand pumps
- Electric lights instead of dangerous kerosene lamps
- Power for milk machines and other farm equipment
- Radio for entertainment and news (like getting internet for the first time! ㅋㅋㅋ)

By 1950, over 90% of farms had electricity! It totally transformed rural life, especially for farm wives who finally got modern appliances.

Common criticism: Some private utility companies complained it was unfair government competition, and some said it made farmers dependent on government loans.
