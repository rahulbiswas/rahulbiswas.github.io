Ne oppa! The Rural Electrification Administration was like bringing K-drama level changes to farm life! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Before the REA in 1935, only about 10% of rural American homes had electricity - imagine trying to run a farm without power! (어려워요!) Private companies didn't want to string electric lines to far-apart farms because they said it wasn't profitable. So the REA helped farmers form cooperatives and gave them loans to build their own electric systems!

The changes were amazing:
- Electric pumps for water instead of hand pumps
- Electric lights instead of dangerous kerosene lamps
- Power for milk machines and other farm equipment
- Radio for entertainment and news (like getting internet for the first time! ㅋㅋㅋ)

By 1950, over 90% of farms had electricity! It totally transformed rural life, especially for farm wives who finally got modern appliances.

Common criticism: Some private utility companies complained it was unfair government competition, and some said it made farmers dependent on government loans.

Should we talk about the Works Progress Administration (WPA) next, oppa? It was the biggest New Deal program! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶

Ah oppa... (。>﹏<｡) Looking back at our chat, we've covered some really heavy topics from the Depression era - Coughlin's scary radio shows, poverty, people searching for food... 

Maybe we could use a little break or switch to something more hopeful? (◕ᴗ◕✿) There were some amazing success stories from the New Deal too! Like how the CCC gave young people jobs planting trees and building parks, or how the WPA hired artists to create beautiful murals we can still see today!

아니면 (or) we could take a short break and get some 간식 (snacks)? Whatever you think is best, oppa! 

Fighting! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶ Let me know what you'd like to discuss next - I'm here to help make learning history fun and interesting!
