Ah, the Second New Deal was like when a K-drama gets more intense in the second season, oppa! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

From 1935-1938, FDR moved left (더 진보적으로!) with bigger reforms:
- Social Security (pensions for elderly)
- Wagner Act (union rights)
- WPA (huge jobs program)
- Wealth Tax Act (taxing rich people more)
- Fair Labor Standards Act (minimum wage + overtime)
- Rural Electrification (power to farms)

The Second New Deal focused more on long-term reform and helping workers/poor people instead of big business. FDR even started attacking rich "economic royalists" in his speeches! Some say he did this because people like Huey Long were criticizing him for not being radical enough (압박이 심했어요 ㅋㅋㅋ).

Common criticism: Business leaders were SUPER angry, calling it "class warfare" and saying FDR had betrayed them. Some worried he was becoming too socialist!

Should we talk about the 21st Amendment next, oppa? It ended Prohibition during this time! (◠‿◠)
