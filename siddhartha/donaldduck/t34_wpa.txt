Ne oppa! The Works Progress Administration was HUGE - like a whole army of workers making America better! (◠‿◠)ノ

From 1935-1943, the WPA employed about 8.5 million people (대박!) to build all kinds of public projects:
- 650,000 miles of roads
- 125,000 buildings
- 8,000 parks
- Tons of schools, hospitals, and airports

But what makes it super special was its art projects! They hired artists, writers, musicians, and actors who were struggling (like giving BTS their first chance, but in the 1930s! ㅋㅋㅋ). They:
- Painted beautiful murals in post offices
- Wrote state guidebooks
- Performed plays for communities
- Recorded ex-slave narratives
- Even made puppet shows for kids!

Common criticism: Critics called it "We Poke Along" because they thought workers were lazy, and some complained about art projects being wasteful when people needed "real jobs." Conservative politicians said it was just buying votes with make-work projects.
