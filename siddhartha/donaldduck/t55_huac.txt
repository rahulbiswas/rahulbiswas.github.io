Ah, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)! (。>﹏<｡)

Created in 1938 (during the New Deal), HUAC was super scary (진짜 무서웠어요). It was supposed to investigate:
- Nazi propaganda (좋은 생각!)
- But then mostly focused on looking for communists
- Questioned people about their political beliefs
- Made people name their friends/colleagues as communists
- Could ruin careers if people didn't cooperate

Even though it started during the New Deal, HUAC became most famous later during the Cold War when it:
- Investigated Hollywood (many actors/writers blacklisted!)
- Worked with Senator McCarthy
- Made people take loyalty oaths
- Created a really fearful atmosphere

Common criticism: Many said it violated civil liberties and created witch hunts. Even Eleanor Roosevelt spoke against it! It's like if the government made a committee to decide who was a "real" Korean or not... (이상하죠?)
