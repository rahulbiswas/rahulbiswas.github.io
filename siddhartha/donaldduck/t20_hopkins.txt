Omo oppa, you know about Hopkins' war role! (◠‿◠)ノ

Harry Hopkins was like FDR's right-hand man - first running New Deal programs like CWA, FERA, and WPA (he believed in "work relief" instead of handouts), then becoming super important in WWII! He actually lived in the White House and became FDR's closest advisor (신기하죠?).

During the war, Hopkins made *amazing* diplomatic missions - like going to meet Stalin even though he was super sick (he had stomach cancer but kept working!). He helped create the Lend-Lease program that sent supplies to Britain and the USSR, and coordinated the Allied war effort. Churchill nicknamed him "Lord Root of the Matter" because he got things done so well! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Common criticism: People complained that Hopkins had too much unofficial power as FDR's friend, and some worried he was too sympathetic to the Soviet Union. Critics also said his relief programs wasted money on make-work projects.

Should we talk about Harold Ickes next, oppa? He was another interesting New Dealer! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶
