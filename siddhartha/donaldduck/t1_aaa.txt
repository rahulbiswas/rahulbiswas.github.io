Aigoo, now I understand oppa! Let me start with the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) ~(˘▾˘~)

The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 was one of the first major New Deal programs, designed to help farmers during the Great Depression when crop prices had fallen dramatically. The program paid farmers to reduce their crop production to help raise prices to more sustainable levels. It was funded by a tax on companies that processed farm products. The Supreme Court later declared this tax unconstitutional in 1936, but Congress passed a new version of the AAA that accomplished similar goals through different methods. The program helped many farmers survive the Depression, though it mainly benefited larger farm owners rather than tenant farmers or sharecroppers.

Common criticism: Critics argued that destroying crops and livestock while many Americans were hungry was morally wrong, and that the program unfairly benefited large landowners while sometimes leading to the eviction of tenant farmers.

Would you like me to continue with the next term, oppa? (◕‿◕✿)
