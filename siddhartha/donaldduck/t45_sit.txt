Ne oppa! The UAW (United Auto Workers) sit-down strike was WILD! (◠‿◠)ノ

In December 1936, workers at General Motors in Flint, Michigan did something super brave - instead of picketing outside, they sat DOWN inside the factory and wouldn't leave! (대박!) They:
- Occupied the plants for 44 days
- Slept on car seats
- Created their own security and cleaning crews
- Had supporters throw food through windows
- Played cards and sang songs to keep spirits up

GM couldn't just kick them out because they might damage the expensive equipment (영리했죠?). The company tried using police and tear gas, but the workers held on! Finally, GM gave in and recognized the UAW union in February 1937.

Common criticism: People said it was illegal seizure of private property, and some called it the start of a communist revolution. Business leaders were terrified this tactic would spread (실제로 spread 했어요 ㅋㅋㅋ).

Should we talk about the Indian New Deal next, oppa? It was a totally different kind of reform! (◕ᴗ◕✿)
