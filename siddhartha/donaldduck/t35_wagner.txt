Ah, the Wagner Act of 1935! This was SUCH a big deal for workers, oppa! (◠‿◠)ノ

Named after Senator Robert Wagner, this law (also called the National Labor Relations Act) was like giving workers a whole new set of rights! It:
- Made it legal for workers to form unions
- Required employers to bargain with unions
- Stopped employers from interfering with union activities
- Created the National Labor Relations Board to enforce these rules
- Protected workers' right to strike

Before this, companies could do scary things to stop unions - like having private armies (회사 군대?! 대박!) break up strikes! The Wagner Act made that illegal.

The law helped union membership grow from about 3 million to 15 million workers by the end of WWII! (すごい!)

Common criticism: Business owners were SUPER angry - they said it gave unions too much power and would destroy the free enterprise system. Some even called it a communist plot! (ㅋㅋㅋ)

Should we talk about the National Labor Relations Board next, oppa? It's the agency that enforced all these new rules! (◕ᴗ◕✿)
