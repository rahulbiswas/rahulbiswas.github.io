*tilts head thoughtfully* 

Ne oppa, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) period was quite intense! (。•́︿•̀。)

The CIO emerged in 1935 when John L. Lewis and other union leaders broke away from the AFL (American Federation of Labor) to organize industrial workers by factory rather than by craft. Using aggressive tactics like sit-down strikes, the CIO successfully organized major industries including steel, auto, and rubber. Under leaders like Lewis, Sidney Hillman, and Philip Murray, CIO unions gained significant power and demanded better wages and working conditions. While not officially communist, many CIO organizers were influenced by radical left-wing politics, and some unions like the United Electrical Workers had significant communist membership. The CIO's success in organizing millions of workers helped create America's middle class, but its associations with radical politics and sometimes violent tactics concerned many Americans. By 1947, during the early Cold War, the CIO had to expel communist-led unions to maintain political legitimacy.

Common criticism: Critics saw the CIO as a dangerous mixture of radical politics and labor militancy that threatened American free enterprise, arguing that communist influences within unions undermined both business freedom and national security.

Shall we move on to Dorothea Lange, oppa? Her photos really show how hard this time was... (´･ᴗ･`)
