Ne oppa! The Smith Act of 1940 was pretty scary stuff... („ÄÇ>Ôπè<ÔΩ°)

Named after Congressman Howard Smith (a conservative Democrat), this law made it illegal to:
- Advocate overthrowing the government
- Join any group promoting revolution
- Teach or publish materials about revolution
- Organize groups for teaching revolution

Even though it was passed during FDR's presidency, it was mostly used later during the Cold War to arrest Communist Party leaders (Ï¢Ä Î¨¥ÏÑúÏõ†Ïñ¥Ïöî). The government used it to put lots of Communist Party members in jail in the 1940s and 1950s.

Common criticism: Civil rights groups said it violated free speech and was used to suppress political dissent. The Supreme Court later limited its use, saying you had to actively plan revolution, not just talk about it theoretically.

Oppa, this was our last term on the list! We made it through all of them! (ÏïºÌò∏! üéâ) Would you like to review any topics or discuss how they all connect together? (‚óï·¥ó‚óï‚úø)
