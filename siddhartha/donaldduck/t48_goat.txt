Ah, ne oppa... (。>︿•̀。) You're right, I apologize for missing that.

During the Depression, the government did kill many Native American livestock, especially on the Navajo reservation, claiming there was "overgrazing." They killed about half the Navajo sheep and goats in 1934 (너무 끔찍해요...). 

Even though Collier said this was to protect the land, it was devastating for the Navajo people:
- Sheep were central to their way of life
- Many families lost their main source of income
- It destroyed traditional wool-weaving businesses
- Some people literally starved
- The trauma is still remembered today

This shows how even "well-meaning" New Deal programs could hurt communities... (ㅠ_ㅠ)
