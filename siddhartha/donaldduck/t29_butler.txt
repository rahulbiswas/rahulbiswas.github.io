Ne oppa! United States v. Butler (1936) was a really big case! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

The Supreme Court struck down the first Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) in this case. The issue was about the processing tax that paid for farmer subsidies - the Court said Congress couldn't use its taxing power to regulate agriculture because that was supposed to be a state power, not federal! 

It was like a legal drama! (ㅋㅋㅋ) The Butler brothers were grain processors who said the tax was unfair. Even though the Court agreed the Great Depression was terrible for farmers, they said the Constitution didn't allow this solution. Justice Roberts wrote that Congress couldn't use its spending power to achieve goals it couldn't regulate directly.

But you know what's interesting, oppa? FDR's team quickly wrote a new AAA that worked differently, and that one survived! (아자아자 fighting!)

Common criticism: Some legal scholars said the Court's reasoning was too narrow and ignored the real emergency of the Depression.

Should we talk about Upton Sinclair next? He ran for governor of California with a crazy plan called EPIC! (◠‿◠)
