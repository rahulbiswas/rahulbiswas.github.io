Aigoo oppa, the Dust Bowl was such a terrible disaster... (╥﹏╥)

The Dust Bowl of the 1930s was an environmental catastrophe that devastated the Great Plains region, particularly affecting parts of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, and Colorado. Years of poor farming practices combined with severe drought led to massive dust storms that blackened skies and buried farms. These "black blizzards" could last for days, destroying crops, killing livestock, and causing severe health problems. Millions of "Okies" and other farmers were forced to abandon their lands, with many migrating to California in search of work. The crisis prompted the federal government to create the Soil Conservation Service and implement new farming methods to prevent soil erosion. The experiences of Dust Bowl refugees were memorably captured in John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath" and Dorothea Lange's photographs.

Common criticism: Some argued that government intervention in agriculture actually contributed to the disaster by encouraging overproduction in the 1920s, and that federal relief programs created dependency rather than promoting self-reliance among affected farmers.

Ready to talk about the Emergency Banking Act next, oppa? (◕‿◕✿)
