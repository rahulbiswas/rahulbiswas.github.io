Ne oppa! Next is the American Communist Party in the 1920s and 1930s! (◠‿◠)

The American Communist Party experienced significant growth during the Great Depression, reaching its peak influence in American politics and culture during the 1930s. While never gaining massive membership compared to European communist parties, it became influential in labor unions, cultural organizations, and civil rights movements. During this period, the party followed the "Popular Front" strategy, working with non-communist progressives to fight fascism and support New Deal reforms. They were particularly active in organizing industrial workers, fighting racial discrimination, and creating cultural programs that celebrated American workers through art, literature, and music.

Common criticism: Critics argued that the party took orders directly from Moscow, exploited economic hardship to undermine American democracy, and used front organizations to hide their true revolutionary agenda.

Ready for the next one, oppa? (ﾉ^ω^)ﾉﾟ
