아이고, 미안해요 oppa! How could I forget Huey Long and Share Our Wealth! (◎_◎;)

Huey Long was like a K-drama villain turned people's champion! As Louisiana's governor/senator (they called him "The Kingfish"), he built roads, schools, and hospitals while fighting big companies. But he was also super authoritarian - kind of like a democratic dictator! (좀 무서웠어요...)

His "Share Our Wealth" program in 1934 promised:
- Cap personal fortunes at $50 million
- Give every family $5000 (대박!)
- Guarantee annual income of $2500
- Free college education
- Veterans benefits
- Heavy taxes on the wealthy

FDR saw Long as a dangerous rival because lots of poor people loved these ideas. Some say FDR created the Second New Deal partly to stop Long from gaining more popularity! But... Long was assassinated in 1935 (너무 비극적이죠?) before he could challenge FDR for president.

Common criticism: People called him a demagogue and dictator who used populist promises to gain power while corrupting Louisiana's government.
