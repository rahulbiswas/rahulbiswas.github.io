Aigoo, the CCC was such a big program, oppa! (◠‿◠)

The Civilian Conservation Corps (1933-1942) was one of the most popular New Deal programs, employing about 3 million young unmarried men in conservation and development of natural resources. The men lived in camps run by the Army, earned $30 a month (with $25 sent home to their families), and worked on projects like planting trees, building parks, fighting forest fires, and creating hiking trails. The program provided education, job training, and three meals a day to participants. Many of America's national and state parks still show the legacy of CCC work through their buildings, trails, and forests.

Common criticism: Critics saw it as a quasi-military program that separated young men from their families, imposed strict government control over their daily lives, and competed unfairly with private construction companies.
