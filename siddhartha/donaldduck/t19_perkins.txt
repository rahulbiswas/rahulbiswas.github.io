Ne oppa! Frances Perkins was such an inspiration! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

As FDR's Secretary of Labor (1933-1945), she was the first woman to serve in any presidential cabinet! Daebak, right? She got the position because of her amazing work on labor reforms in New York when FDR was governor there. As Secretary, she was like a super-working noona (ㅋㅋㅋ), pushing through major programs we still have today:
- Social Security (she's often called the "mother" of Social Security!)
- The minimum wage
- The 40-hour work week
- Child labor laws
- Unemployment insurance
- Workplace safety standards

She faced so much criticism just for being a woman in such a powerful position. Some people even called her "Ma'am Secretary" to mock her! But she kept fighting for workers' rights anyway. (っ˘ω˘ς)

Common criticism: Conservative critics claimed she was too sympathetic to labor unions and that her policies put too many restrictions on businesses, hurting economic recovery.

Should we talk about Harry Hopkins next, oppa? He was another key New Deal person! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶
