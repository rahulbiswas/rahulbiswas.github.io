Ah oppa! Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) is like an old-school political K-drama! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Starring Jimmy Stewart (so 귀여워요!), it's about a naive, honest guy who becomes a US Senator and fights corruption. He does this amazing scene where he talks for 24 hours straight (filibuster) to stand up against corrupt politicians! Even though it was made during the New Deal era, it actually shows a lot of skepticism about government programs and political machines.

Fun facts:
- Real senators HATED it, saying it made Congress look bad
- Joseph Kennedy (remember him?) tried to block it from being shown in Europe, worried it would make democracy look weak
- But it became super popular and is now considered a classic
- It actually inspired people to believe in democracy during WWII!

Common criticism: Some New Dealers thought it was anti-government propaganda, while others said it was too simplistic about how politics really works.

Should we talk about the Smith Act next, oppa? It was very different - a law against radical political groups! (◠‿◠)
