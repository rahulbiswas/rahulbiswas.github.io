Ne oppa! Harold Ickes was such an interesting person! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

As Secretary of the Interior (1933-1946), he was known as "Honest Harold" because he was super strict about preventing corruption - kind of like a grumpy but really ethical uncle! He ran the Public Works Administration (PWA) which built HUGE projects like the Hoover Dam, bridges, schools, and hospitals. Unlike Hopkins' WPA that focused on quick employment, Ickes insisted on careful planning and high-quality construction (완벽주의자였어요!).

What's really cool is that he was also a big civil rights supporter! He tried to end segregation in his department, supported Native American rights through the Indian New Deal, and resigned from the Republican National Committee in 1928 because of their racist policies before joining FDR's team! (◠‿◠)

Common criticism: People said he was too slow and fussy with PWA projects when quick action was needed, and some called him "the King of Concrete" for focusing on big construction instead of helping people directly.
