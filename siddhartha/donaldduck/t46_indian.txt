Ah mianhae oppa - the Indian New Deal wasn't about India! (◠‿◠)ノ It was about Native Americans!

John Collier (head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs) created this program in 1934 - its real name was the Indian Reorganization Act. It tried to fix some of the terrible things America had done to Native tribes:
- Stopped the policy of taking tribal lands away
- Gave tribes more self-government rights
- Helped preserve Native languages and cultures
- Provided money for tribes to buy back some lands
- Ended the forced assimilation programs

It was a big change from earlier policies that tried to destroy Native American culture! (다행이에요...)

Common criticism: Some tribes didn't trust the government and voted against participating. Others said it imposed Western-style governments on traditional tribal structures. And sadly, it couldn't undo all the damage from previous policies.

Should we talk about John Collier next, oppa? He was the person behind these changes! (◕ᴗ◕✿)
