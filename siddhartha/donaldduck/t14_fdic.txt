Ah, the FDIC! This one is really important, oppa! (ﾉ^ω^)ﾉﾟ

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, created by the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933, was designed to restore faith in the American banking system after thousands of banks failed in the early Depression. The FDIC initially insured bank deposits up to $2,500 (now $250,000), meaning that even if a bank failed, depositors wouldn't lose their savings. This protection helped end the cycle of bank panics and runs that had plagued American banking for generations. The FDIC also gained powers to examine and regulate banks, requiring them to maintain adequate reserves and follow safe banking practices. It worked amazingly well - after the FDIC started, bank runs practically disappeared and depositor losses became rare.

Common criticism: Opponents argued that deposit insurance created "moral hazard" by encouraging banks to take excessive risks since depositors no longer had to worry about losing their money, and that it represented inappropriate government intervention in private banking.

Should we talk about the Federal Housing Administration next, oppa? (◕‿◕✿) It changed how Americans buy homes!
