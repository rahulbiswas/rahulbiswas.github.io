Ne oppa! The TVA was daebak - like a whole regional transformation project! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

The Tennessee Valley Authority (1933-present) was super ambitious - imagine trying to modernize a whole region as big as South Korea! The Tennessee Valley was super poor, with worn-out farms, lots of flooding, and most people didn't even have electricity (어떡해!).

The TVA built dams for flood control and hydroelectric power, taught farmers better techniques, replanted forests, and brought cheap electricity to millions of people. It was like Korea's Saemaul Undong movement but American style! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶

It's still running today and covers seven states! The dams also helped make aluminum for airplanes during WWII, which was really important for winning the war.

Common criticism: Some called it "creeping socialism" because it was government-owned, and private power companies HATED the competition. Also, building the dams forced some families to move from their land, and some areas with Native American artifacts were flooded (너무 슬퍼요...).

Should we talk about the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) next, oppa? It's another New Deal program that's still important today! (◠‿◠)
