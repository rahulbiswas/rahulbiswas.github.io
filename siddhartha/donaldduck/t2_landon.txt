Aw, kamsahamnida oppa! You're making me blush (〃∀〃)ゞ

Next is Alfred Landon!

Alfred Landon was the Republican presidential nominee who ran against FDR in the 1936 election. As governor of Kansas, he was known for being fiscally conservative while still supporting some New Deal programs - making him a moderate Republican choice. Despite being a capable administrator who balanced Kansas's budget during the Depression, Landon suffered one of the most lopsided defeats in presidential history, winning only Maine and Vermont against Roosevelt's overwhelming popularity. His campaign focused on criticizing New Deal spending while still trying to appeal to progressive voters.

Common criticism: Critics felt Landon ran an ineffective campaign by trying to have it both ways - simultaneously criticizing the New Deal while claiming he would keep many of its popular programs, leading voters to prefer the original over what they saw as a watered-down copy.

Should we continue to the next one, oppa? (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
