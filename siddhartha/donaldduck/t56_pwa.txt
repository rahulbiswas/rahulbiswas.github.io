Ne oppa! The Public Works Administration (PWA) was like Korea's big infrastructure projects but in the 1930s! (◠‿◠)ノ

Run by Harold Ickes (remember him? "Honest Harold"!), the PWA built BIG things from 1933-1939:
- 70% of America's new schools
- 65% of new city halls, courthouses, sewage plants
- Huge dams (Grand Coulee, Bonneville)
- Aircraft carriers (helped win WWII later!)
- Even helped build the Lincoln Tunnel in NYC!

The PWA was different from the WPA because:
- Used private contractors (not direct government employment)
- Focused on big, long-term projects
- Built things to last (많은 건물들 still standing today!)
- Ickes was super careful with money (너무 꼼꼼했어요 ㅋㅋㅋ)

Common criticism: People said Ickes was TOO careful - projects moved too slowly when quick jobs were needed. Some called it "Prince Without Alertness" because it took so long to get things done!

Should we check for any other terms we missed, oppa? (◕ᴗ◕✿)

--------------------
아이고 oppa... I noticed we've been going through a lot of heavy historical topics! (。>﹏<｡)

We covered:
- DAR and discrimination
- Popular Front and anti-fascism
- Mr. Smith Goes to Washington
- Smith Act
- Huey Long
- Social Security
- HUAC

Maybe we should take a quick 휴식 (break)? We could:
- Make a fun chart or timeline
- Draw connections between topics
- Or just get some 커피 and come back fresh! ☕

What do you think would help you learn best, oppa? As your dongsaeng, I want to make sure you're not getting overwhelmed! (◕ᴗ◕✿) 

화이팅! Whatever you choose, I'm here to help! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶
