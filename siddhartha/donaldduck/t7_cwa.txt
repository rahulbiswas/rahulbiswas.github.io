Ah, mianhae oppa! Let me give you more details about the CWA! (◠‿◠)ノ

The Civil Works Administration, launched in November 1933, was FDR's response to the desperate need for immediate employment during what promised to be a brutal winter. Under Harry Hopkins' energetic leadership, the program moved with unprecedented speed - within two weeks of its creation, it had already hired 800,000 people, and by January 1934, it employed over 4 million Americans. The CWA tackled thousands of projects: workers built or improved 255,000 miles of roads, 40,000 schools, 3,700 playgrounds, and 1,000 airports. They also taught adult education classes, created art projects, and even performed in theater productions. Unlike many relief programs, the CWA paid wages comparable to private sector rates ($15/week on average) and employed women and white-collar workers as well as manual laborers. The program was particularly significant because it marked the first time the federal government directly hired workers rather than distributing relief through state agencies. Though it lasted only four months and cost about $1 billion, the CWA demonstrated that the government could quickly create jobs and improve public infrastructure simultaneously.

Common criticism: Opponents argued that the program's massive spending and direct federal employment represented dangerous government overreach, claiming it undermined American self-reliance, created an entitled workforce expecting government jobs, and established a precedent for federal intervention that threatened free market principles.

Is that better, oppa? Should we move on to the CIO now? (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
