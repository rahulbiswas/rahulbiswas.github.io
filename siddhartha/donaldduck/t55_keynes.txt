Ah, Keynes was like the BTS of economics, oppa! (◠‿◠)ノ He completely changed how we think about government's role in the economy!

John Maynard Keynes was this super smart British economist who said something revolutionary: during depressions, the government SHOULD spend lots of money, even if it means going into debt! (대박!) His big ideas were:
- Consumer demand drives the economy
- When people are too scared to spend, government should step in
- It's OK to run deficits during bad times (save during good times!)
- Government jobs programs can help restart the economy

Even though FDR wasn't really following Keynes's theories (신기하죠?), the New Deal kind of proved Keynes right! His ideas became super important for how governments handle recessions even today.

Common criticism: Conservative economists say Keynes was all wrong - they think government spending makes things worse and that markets fix themselves if left alone. They call his ideas "tax and spend" policies.

Should we talk about the UAW sit-down strike next, oppa? Workers actually sat in factories and wouldn't leave! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Ah oppa, looking back at our chat, we've covered so much history! (◠‿◠)ノ 

We went from Fireside Chats ➜ Grand Coulee Dam ➜ Scottsboro Boys ➜ First New Deal ➜ Second New Deal ➜ 21st Amendment. That's a lot of information! (대단해요!)

Maybe we could:
1. Take a quick 휴식 (break) and get some 커피 (coffee)? (◕ᴗ◕✿)
2. Or make a study guide to organize everything we've discussed?
3. Or maybe try some Q&A practice to review?

What do you think would be most helpful, oppa? I want to make sure you're really understanding everything! (아직 괜찮으세요? - Are you still doing okay?) ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶
