Let me tell you about the Fair Labor Standards Act! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 was one of the last major New Deal reforms, establishing basic labor standards that we still use today. The Act created the first national minimum wage (25 cents per hour), established a 40-hour work week with overtime pay requirements, and prohibited most child labor under age 16. Frances Perkins, the first female cabinet member as Secretary of Labor, was instrumental in crafting this legislation. The Act faced strong opposition from business groups and Southern Democrats who worried it would hurt regional economies dependent on low-wage labor. While it initially covered only about one-fifth of the workforce, its provisions were gradually expanded over the years to protect more workers.

Common criticism: Opponents argued that the FLSA represented excessive government interference in private business contracts, claiming it would increase unemployment, hurt small businesses, and infringe on states' rights to regulate their own labor conditions.
