The Emergency Banking Act was one of FDR's first big moves! (◠‿◠)

The Emergency Banking Act of 1933 was passed just days after FDR's inauguration during the famous "bank holiday" when all banks were temporarily closed. The Act gave the president broad powers to regulate banking transactions and foreign exchange, reform, and reopen banks. Banks were inspected and only those deemed sound were allowed to reopen, with the government providing support to stabilize them. FDR explained the Act in his first Fireside Chat, helping restore public confidence in the banking system. When banks began reopening, people found their money was safe and started returning their cash to banks instead of hiding it under mattresses. This quick action helped stop the banking panic and marked the beginning of federal deposit insurance and stronger banking regulations.

Common criticism: Critics saw this as a massive federal power grab over private banking, arguing it gave the government too much control over private financial institutions and set a dangerous precedent for executive authority over the economy.
