Ne oppa! Let me tell you about Bonneville Dam~ (´･ᴗ･`)

Bonneville Dam, built between 1933 and 1938 on the Columbia River between Oregon and Washington, was one of the New Deal's major public works projects. The dam served multiple purposes: generating hydroelectric power, improving river navigation, and creating thousands of jobs during the Depression. It was revolutionary for bringing affordable electricity to rural Pacific Northwest communities and powering industrial growth in the region. The project also included innovative fish ladders to help salmon migration, though their effectiveness was debated.

Common criticism: Critics argued the dam disrupted traditional Native American fishing rights, altered natural river ecosystems, and represented excessive government intervention in local affairs through federally controlled power distribution.

Should we check out the Civilian Conservation Corps next, oppa? (ノ^ω^)ノ
