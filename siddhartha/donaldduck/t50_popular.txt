Ne oppa! The Popular Front was like a big coalition against fascism in the 1930s! (◠‿◠)ノ

Starting around 1935, different left-wing groups decided to work together (같이 화이팅!) to fight the rise of Hitler and fascism. In America, this meant:
- Communists cooperating with New Dealers
- Labor unions joining with liberal groups
- Artists and writers creating anti-fascist culture
- Support for Republican Spain against Franco
- Slogan: "Communism is 20th Century Americanism" (좀 이상하죠? ㅋㅋㅋ)

The Popular Front created some really interesting culture:
- Folk music revival
- Pro-labor art and theater
- Progressive films
- Anti-fascist literature

Common criticism: Conservative critics said it was just a Communist trick to gain influence in mainstream American society. The alliance fell apart after the 1939 Nazi-Soviet Pact (너무 충격적이었어요!).

Should we talk about Mr. Smith Goes to Washington next, oppa? It was a famous movie from this era! (◕ᴗ◕✿)
