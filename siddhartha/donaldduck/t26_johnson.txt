Omona oppa, Hugh Johnson was quite a character! (◠‿◠)ノ

As head of the NRA, he was like that super intense manager who's always causing drama! ㅋㅋㅋ He'd give really fiery speeches, calling people who didn't display the Blue Eagle "slackers" and even comparing them to someone who'd shoot their mother! (ᗒᗣᗕ)՞ So dramatic!

Johnson was a former Army officer who ran the NRA like a military campaign - complete with parades, patriotic rallies, and even a massive Blue Eagle parade in New York City with 250,000 marchers! He worked super hard but... he also drank too much and would say really wild things to reporters.

FDR finally had to fire him in 1934 because he was becoming too controversial. Even Eleanor Roosevelt said he was "slightly insane"! (。>﹏<｡)

Common criticism: People said he was too dictatorial and that his aggressive style hurt the NRA's reputation. Some called him a wannabe fascist because of his militaristic approach to economic planning.
