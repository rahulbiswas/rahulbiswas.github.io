Ne oppa! The Filipino Repatriation Act of 1935 is actually a really sad part of history... (。•́︿•̀。)

During the Depression, this law offered to pay for Filipino immigrants' travel if they agreed to return to the Philippines - but with a terrible catch! If they took the offer, they could NEVER return to America. About 2,000 Filipinos took this "offer," often because they faced such horrible discrimination and unemployment here. 

This was extra unfair because Filipinos had a special status - the Philippines was a U.S. territory then! Many had come to America legally as "U.S. nationals." But white workers, especially on the West Coast, blamed them for taking jobs during the Depression and sometimes even attacked Filipino communities! (ㅠ_ㅠ)

Common criticism: This was clearly a racist policy disguised as voluntary "assistance," part of a larger pattern of Asian exclusion in American immigration policy. Even sadder, it came from FDR's administration, which claimed to care about justice and equality.
