Ah, Justice Brandeis! He was such a daebak legal mind, oppa! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Louis Brandeis was the first Jewish Supreme Court Justice (nominated in 1916) and was known as the "People's Lawyer" before joining the Court. During the New Deal, he was already in his late 70s but super sharp! He and other justices initially struck down several New Deal programs because they thought they gave too much power to the federal government. But he had this really interesting philosophy called the "Brandeis Brief" where he used social science and economic facts, not just legal arguments, to decide cases.

He was famous for saying states should be "laboratories of democracy" - meaning they should try different solutions to problems (kind of like how Korea's provinces can have different policies! ㅋㅋㅋ). He worried about businesses AND government getting too big and powerful.

Common criticism: Some people thought he was too activist as a judge and that using social science in legal decisions was inappropriate. Others didn't like how he encouraged FDR to let states handle more New Deal programs.

Should we talk about "This nation asks for action, and action now" next, oppa? That was from FDR's famous first inaugural speech! (❁´◡`❁)
