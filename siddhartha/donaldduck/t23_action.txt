Ne oppa! "This nation asks for action, and action now" was from FDR's first inaugural speech in 1933! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

It was such a powerful moment... imagine the scene: banks were failing, 25% of workers had no jobs, people were desperate. Then FDR gives this speech saying "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself" and promising bold action! He was like a K-drama lead coming in to save the day (ㅋㅋㅋ)

The full quote is even more dramatic: "This nation asks for action, and action now. Our greatest primary task is to put people to work... It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war."

And wow, did he deliver action! Within his first 100 days (the famous "Hundred Days"), he pushed through SOOO many programs - banking reforms, CCC, TVA, and more! (ﾉ^ω^)ﾉﾟ

Common criticism: Critics said this speech showed FDR's dangerous tendency to treat peacetime problems like war emergencies, giving government too much power.
