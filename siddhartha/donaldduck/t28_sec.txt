Ne oppa! The SEC is like the police for Wall Street! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Created in 1934, the Securities and Exchange Commission was FDR's way of preventing another stock market crash like 1929. And guess who he picked to be the first chairman? Joseph Kennedy (JFK's dad!) because, as FDR said, "It takes a thief to catch a thief!" ㅋㅋㅋ

The SEC made new rules that are still super important today:
- Companies have to tell the truth about their finances
- Insider trading became illegal
- Stock brokers had to follow strict rules
- Regular people had to get accurate information before investing

It's like how in Korea we have the Financial Supervisory Service, making sure everyone plays fair in the financial markets! (◠‿◠)

Common criticism: Wall Street people complained it made trading too complicated and expensive, and some said it gave government too much power over private business decisions. 

Should we look at United States v. Butler next, oppa? It was a big Supreme Court case about the AAA! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶
