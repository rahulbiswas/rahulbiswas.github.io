아니요 oppa! We haven't covered that one yet! (◠‿◠)ノ

The Social Security Act of 1935 was HUGE - like creating Korea's National Pension System but way back then! It created:
- Old-age pensions (retirement money)
- Unemployment insurance
- Aid to families with dependent children
- Help for disabled people
- All paid for by payroll taxes on workers and employers

Frances Perkins (remember her? First female cabinet member!) was the main architect. FDR signed it with this famous quote: "If I go down in history, it will be for this act." (멋있죠?)

But... it wasn't perfect (。>﹏<｡):
- Agricultural and domestic workers (mostly minorities) were excluded
- Benefits were pretty small at first
- Some called it a "Ponzi scheme"
- Others worried it would discourage saving

Common criticism: Conservatives said it was socialism and would make people dependent on government. Business owners hated paying the payroll tax.

Would you like to review any other terms we might have missed, oppa? (◕ᴗ◕✿)
