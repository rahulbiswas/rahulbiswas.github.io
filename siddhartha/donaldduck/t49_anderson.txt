Ne oppa! Marian Anderson's story is like a K-drama but it really happened! (â— â€¿â— )ãƒŽ

In 1939, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) refused to let Anderson (a famous Black opera singer) perform at Constitution Hall in Washington DC because she was African American. But Eleanor Roosevelt got so angry she:
- Resigned from the DAR in protest
- Helped arrange an outdoor concert at the Lincoln Memorial instead
- Got the Interior Department (Harold Ickes!) to organize it

On Easter Sunday, Anderson sang for 75,000 people on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial! (ëŒ€ë°•!) She started with "My Country 'Tis of Thee" - imagine how powerful that was, singing about freedom at the Lincoln Memorial after being discriminated against! (ëˆˆë¬¼ë‚˜ìš”... ðŸ˜¢)

Common criticism: Some said the Roosevelts only helped because Anderson was already famous, and that they didn't do enough for ordinary African Americans facing discrimination.

Should we talk about the Popular Front next, oppa? It was about how different groups worked together against fascism! (â—•á´—â—•âœ¿)
