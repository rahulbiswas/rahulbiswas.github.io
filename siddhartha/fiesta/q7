    <question>
        <prompt>Why is the Long-Run Aggregate Supply curve vertical?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Because prices are sticky in the long run</option>
            <option letter="b">Because the economy always produces at full employment in the long run</option>
            <option letter="c">Because wages are fixed in the long run</option>
            <option letter="d">Because aggregate demand determines output in the long run</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The LRAS curve is vertical because in the long run, the economy produces at its full employment level (potential GDP) regardless of the price level, as wages and prices fully adjust.</explanation>

    <question>
        <prompt>What problem is NOT captured in GDP measurements?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Value of intermediate goods</option>
            <option letter="b">Quality of life improvements</option>
            <option letter="c">Services provided by imported goods</option>
            <option letter="d">Government transfer payments</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>GDP does not measure quality of life improvements, including factors like environmental quality, leisure time, or income distribution. It only measures the market value of final goods and services produced.</explanation>

    <question>
        <prompt>How does an inflationary gap affect the price level without government intervention?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Prices fall until full employment is reached</option>
            <option letter="b">Prices rise until actual GDP equals potential GDP</option>
            <option letter="c">Prices remain stable as output adjusts</option>
            <option letter="d">Prices adjust only if the government intervenes</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>In an inflationary gap, excess demand puts upward pressure on wages and prices. Prices continue rising until higher costs reduce output to potential GDP level.</explanation>

    <question>
        <prompt>Which factor would NOT shift the Aggregate Demand curve?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Changes in government spending</option>
            <option letter="b">Changes in interest rates</option>
            <option letter="c">Changes in the price level</option>
            <option letter="d">Changes in consumer wealth</option>
        </options>
        <answer>c</answer>
        <explanation>Changes in the price level cause movement along the existing Aggregate Demand curve rather than shifting it. The other factors are determinants that shift the entire AD curve.</explanation>
