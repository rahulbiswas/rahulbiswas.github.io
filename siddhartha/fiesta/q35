        <prompt>Which best explains why the Long-Run Phillips Curve is vertical?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Because prices are sticky in the long run</option>
            <option letter="b">Because unemployment always equals zero in the long run</option>

            <option letter="d">Because wages are fixed in the long run</option>
        </options>
        <answer>c</answer>
