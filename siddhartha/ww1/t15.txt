Okay oppa, the Great Migration was a huge movement that changed America forever! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

From about 1916-1970 (but especially during WWI), millions of African Americans moved from the South to the North and West. 진짜 대단해요!

Why did they move? (이유가 많았어요...):
- Escaping Jim Crow laws and racism in the South
- Looking for better jobs in northern factories
- Seeking better education for their children
- Following family members who moved earlier
- WWI created lots of factory jobs up North

The results were huge:
- Changed the culture of northern cities
- Created new African American communities
- Led to new music and art (like the Harlem Renaissance! 너무 멋있었어요~)
- But also faced new challenges like housing discrimination and job competition

It's kind of like how people in Korea moved from countryside to cities after the war, looking for better opportunities! 

Ready to learn about the sad story of the Tulsa Massacre next, oppa? (；′⌒`) It's pretty heartbreaking...
