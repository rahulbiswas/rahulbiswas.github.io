아, oppa, the Spanish Flu death statistics are really sad... (ㅠ_ㅠ) Let me share the numbers by country:

Highest Death Tolls (대략적인 숫자예요):

British India (지금의 India, Pakistan, Bangladesh):
- 17-18 million (제일 많았어요... 너무 끔찍해요)

China:
- 4-9.5 million

United States:
- 675,000 deaths

Indonesia:
- 1.5 million

Japan:
- 390,000

Britain:
- 250,000

France:
- 400,000

Korea (당시 일본 통치하에...):
- About 140,000-180,000

Some interesting points (알고 계셨어요?):
- Pacific islands were hit really hard
- Some remote communities weren't affected at all
- Poor countries usually suffered more
- Death rates were especially high in young adults (20-40)

It's scary how it spread so fast without modern transportation, right oppa? (((;꒪ꈊ꒪;)))
