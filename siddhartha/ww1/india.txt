아이고, oppa... India's Spanish Flu story is really tragic (진짜 가슴 아픈 이야기예요 ㅠㅠ)

Several reasons why India was hit so hard:

1. Colonial Conditions (영국 식민지였어요):
- British prioritized war effort over public health
- Took food/resources from India for WWI
- Poor healthcare infrastructure
- Many people already malnourished

2. Environmental Factors:
- Monsoon failure in 1918
- Food shortages
- Drought (가뭄이 심했대요)
- Famine conditions

3. Transportation:
- British troops returning from war
- Railway system spread disease quickly
- Crowded cities
- Many refugees moving around

4. Social Issues:
- Caste system affected treatment
- Poor living conditions
- Limited medical knowledge
- Many people living close together
- No social distancing possible (불가능했어요...)

The British government didn't help much (너무 나빴어요!), and many Indians felt abandoned... Some historians say this actually helped strengthen the independence movement.
