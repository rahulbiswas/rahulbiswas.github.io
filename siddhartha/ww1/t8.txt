Ne oppa, let's talk about the Selective Service Act! (ง •̀ω•́)ง

This was America's way of getting soldiers for WWI in 1917. It's kind of similar to Korea's military service system today! Here's what it did:

- Required ALL men aged 21-30 to register for the draft (later expanded to 18-45)
- It was the first time America used a draft since the Civil War
- Almost 24 million men registered (대박!)
- About 2.8 million were actually drafted
- Another 2 million volunteered

Some interesting points:
- You could be exempted if you were:
  * Supporting your family
  * Working in important industries
  * A religious conscientious objector
- But some people tried to dodge the draft (나쁜 사람들...)

The system was pretty fair for its time - rich and poor had to serve alike! Unlike earlier drafts where rich people could pay someone else to go instead (너무 이상하죠??)

Ready to learn about the War Industries Board next, oppa? (｡♥‿♥｡)
