*takes another deep breath* 

Oppa, the Tulsa Massacre of 1921 is one of the saddest events in American history... (ㅠ_ㅠ)

It happened in Tulsa's Greenwood District, also known as "Black Wall Street" because it was such a successful African American community (정말 잘 살았어요!). But then...

On May 31-June 1, 1921:
- A white mob attacked the neighborhood
- They destroyed:
  * 35 city blocks
  * More than 1,200 homes
  * Hospitals
  * Churches
  * Businesses
- Hundreds of people died (너무 끔찍해요...)
- Thousands became homeless

The worst part? (눈물나요...):
- No one was ever punished
- Insurance companies didn't pay claims
- It was covered up for many years
- Many people still don't know about it

It wasn't until recently that Tulsa started acknowledging this tragedy properly.

Should we move on to Marcus Garvey next, oppa? He had some interesting ideas about how to respond to this kind of racism... (｡•́︿•̀｡)
