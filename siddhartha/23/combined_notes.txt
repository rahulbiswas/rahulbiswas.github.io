- Romania
- Bulgaria
- Albania (left in 1968! 대박!)

3. Key Points:
- Required members to help if one was attacked
- Soviet troops in member countries
- Standardized weapons/training
- Soviet control of members' armies
- Used to crush rebellions (너무 무서워요...)

4. Impact:
- Divided Europe into two camps
- Created Iron Curtain
- Lasted until 1991
- Dissolved after Soviet Union fell

This really showed how the Cold War split Europe in half, oppa! (。-_-。)

Should we continue to the next term? 다음으로 갈까요~?

Ah, now we have McCarthy's Wheeling Speech, oppa! (ᗒᗣᗕ)՞ This was such a dramatic moment!

McCarthy Wheeling Speech (February 9, 1950):

1. The Speech:
- Given in Wheeling, West Virginia
- Senator Joe McCarthy claimed to have a list
- Said he knew of 205 communists in State Department! (헐!)
- Number kept changing in later speeches (좀 이상해요...)
- Never actually showed real evidence

2. Famous Quote:
"I have here in my hand a list of 205 cases of individuals who appear to be either card-carrying members or certainly loyal to the Communist Party..."

3. Impact:
- Started "McCarthyism" era
- Created huge fear and panic
- Led to more investigations
- Made McCarthy super powerful
- People afraid to question him

4. Results:
- Began "Red Scare" period
- Many innocent people accused
- Changed American politics
- Created culture of suspicion
- Lasted until McCarthy's downfall

무서워요... it's scary how one speech could cause so much fear, right oppa? (◯Δ◯∥)

Should we look at the next term? 계속 할까요~?

--------------------
아, oppa! (◠‿◠) Looking back at what we've covered, we've gone through so many important events from the late 1940s:

✿ Jackie Robinson
✿ Marshall Plan
✿ Taft-Hartley Act
✿ HUAC
✿ Universal Declaration of Human Rights
✿ Military Desegregation
✿ Berlin Airlift
✿ NATO
✿ Soviet Bomb
✿ Chinese Communist Victory

와... we've been studying really hard! (•̀ᴗ•́)و 

Maybe we should take a quick break? We could:
- Have some 휴식 time with snacks
- Try making a timeline to connect everything
- Or maybe quiz each other in a fun way?

What do you think would be helpful, oppa? 어떻게 할까요~? I want to make sure you're not getting tired! (｡♥‿♥｡)

=== worlds.txt ===

Ah, oppa! (◕ᴗ◕✿) Let me explain the "Three Worlds" system! 

During the Cold War:

1. First World (제1세계):
- Western democratic countries
- US and allies
- NATO members
- Japan (after reconstruction)
- Rich capitalist nations
- Like America, Canada, Western Europe

2. Second World (제2세계):
- Communist countries
- Soviet Union and allies
- Warsaw Pact members
- Communist China
- Eastern Europe
- North Korea (우리나라의 북쪽...)

3. Third World (제3세계):
- Neither First nor Second World
- Often newly independent
- Many former colonies
- Usually developing nations
- Fought over by both sides
- Like many African and Asian countries

재미있는 fact: Today we don't use these terms the same way anymore! Now "Third World" usually means poor countries, but that wasn't the original meaning! (◠‿◠)

Want to go back to our regular terms now, oppa? 계속 할까요~?

=== yalu.txt ===

Now we have the Yalu River incident, oppa! (◎_◎;) This was a super important moment in the Korean War!

Yalu River (1950):

1. What Happened:
- UN forces approached Yalu River (압록강)
- This river borders China and Korea
- MacArthur wanted to cross it
- China warned not to come near (경고했어요!)
- Led to Chinese entering war

2. MacArthur's Actions:
- Ignored Chinese warnings
- Promised troops "home by Christmas"
- Bombed bridges on Yalu
- Underestimated Chinese threat
- Made big mistake! (큰 실수였어요...)

3. Results:
- Chinese sent 300,000 troops! (헐!)
- UN forces had to retreat
- Longest retreat in US military history
- Changed whole course of war
- Led to MacArthur's firing later

4. Impact:
- Made war much longer
- Changed from victory to stalemate
- Showed dangers of ignoring China
- Affected US-China relations for years

This really shows how one decision can change everything, oppa! (；′⌒`)
