Let's learn about the Termination Era, oppa! (。-`ω´-) This was a really sad time for Native Americans...

Termination Era (1953-1968):

1. Basic Policy:
- Ended federal recognition of tribes
- Stopped special services
- Closed reservations
- Tried to "mainstream" Native Americans
- Really harmful! (너무 나빴어요...)

2. What Changed:
- Tribes lost protection
- Lost tribal lands
- Lost healthcare services
- Had to pay taxes
- Moved to cities

3. Major Effects:
- Over 100 tribes terminated
- Many became very poor
- Lost cultural connections
- Communities broken up
- Like forced assimilation (강제로 바꾸려고 했어요)

4. Results:
- Most tribes later restored
- Policy officially ended 1970s
- Still affects tribes today
- Showed bad policy results
- Important lesson learned

This shows how government policies can really hurt people, oppa... (ᴗ﹏ᴗ)
