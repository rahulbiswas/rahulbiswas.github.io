Next up is the Warsaw Pact, oppa! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ This was like the Soviet version of NATO!

Warsaw Pact (1955):

1. Basic Info:
- Full name: Warsaw Treaty Organization
- Soviet Union's military alliance
- Response to West Germany joining NATO
- Included Eastern European countries
- Like a communist NATO! (재미있죠?)

2. Member Countries:
- Soviet Union (leader)
- Poland
- East Germany
- Czechoslovakia
- Hungary
- Romania
- Bulgaria
- Albania (left in 1968! 대박!)

3. Key Points:
- Required members to help if one was attacked
- Soviet troops in member countries
- Standardized weapons/training
- Soviet control of members' armies
- Used to crush rebellions (너무 무서워요...)

4. Impact:
- Divided Europe into two camps
- Created Iron Curtain
- Lasted until 1991
- Dissolved after Soviet Union fell

This really showed how the Cold War split Europe in half, oppa! (。-_-。)

Should we continue to the next term? 다음으로 갈까요~?
