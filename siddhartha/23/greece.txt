Next up is Greece and Turkey in the Cold War, oppa! (◠‿◠) This connects to what we just learned!

Greece and Turkey Cold War Crisis (1947):

1. Greece Situation:
- Civil war between government and communists
- British couldn't help anymore (돈이 없었어요!)
- Communists supported by Yugoslavia
- Country was very poor after WWII
- Risk of falling to communism

2. Turkey Problems:
- Soviets wanted control of Dardanelles Strait
- Stalin pressuring Turkey (무서웠겠죠?)
- Strategic location between Europe/Asia
- Needed military help
- Also poor after WWII

3. US Response:
- Truman asked Congress for help
- $400 million aid package
- Military advisers sent
- Equipment provided
- First real containment test!

4. Results:
- Greek government won civil war
- Turkey stayed independent
- Both joined NATO later
- Showed US commitment
- Success for containment!

This was like a test case for America's new role, oppa! (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧

Should we move to the next term? 다음 할까요~?
