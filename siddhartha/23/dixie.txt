Now let's learn about Operation Dixie, oppa! (。-`ω´-) This was about labor unions in the South!

Operation Dixie (1946-1953):

1. Basic Info:
- Big union organizing campaign
- Tried to unionize Southern workers
- CIO led it (labor federation)
- Wanted to change the South
- Cost millions of dollars! (돈 많이 썼어요!)

2. Goals:
- Organize Southern workers
- Break anti-union resistance
- Help African American workers
- Raise Southern wages
- Fight racial discrimination

3. Problems Faced:
- Strong business opposition
- Racism issues (너무 슬펐어요...)
- Red-baiting (called them communists!)
- Church opposition
- Limited resources

4. Results:
- Mostly failed (실패했어요...)
- Few unions formed
- South stayed anti-union
- Weakened labor movement
- South still less unionized today

This shows how hard social change can be, oppa! (；′⌒`)
