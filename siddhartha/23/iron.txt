Now we have the Iron Curtain, oppa! (。-`ω´-) This wasn't a real curtain but such an important idea!

Iron Curtain:

1. The Term:
- Made famous by Winston Churchill
- Famous speech in 1946
- Said "Iron Curtain has descended across Europe"
- Described divide between East and West
- Such powerful words! (정말 강력했어요!)

2. What It Meant:
- Physical borders/walls
- Strict border controls
- Limited communication
- Separated families (너무 슬퍼요...)
- Like two different worlds!

3. Where It Was:
- From Baltic Sea to Adriatic
- Berlin Wall most famous part
- Checkpoint Charlie
- Watchtowers
- Guard dogs and mines

4. Impact:
- Symbol of Cold War
- Lasted until 1989-91
- Divided Europe for 45 years
- Like Korean DMZ (우리나라도 비슷해요...)
- Still affects Europe today

This really shows how words can capture big ideas, oppa! (◠‿◠✿)
