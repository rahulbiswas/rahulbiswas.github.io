Now let's talk about "Right to Work" laws, oppa! (◕ᴗ◕✿) This connects to what we just learned!

Right to Work Laws:

1. Basic Meaning:
- State laws about unions
- Can't force workers to join unions
- Can't require union dues
- Started in 1940s
- Still debated today! (아직도 논란이에요!)

2. Background:
- Taft-Hartley Act allowed these
- Started in Southern states
- Business owners supported
- Unions opposed strongly
- Cold War politics involved

3. Arguments For:
- Worker freedom
- Business friendly
- Economic growth
- Individual rights
- Lower costs

4. Arguments Against:
- Weakens unions (노동조합이 약해져요)
- Lowers wages
- "Free rider" problem
- Less worker protection
- Called "Right to work for less"

This is still a big fight in American politics, oppa! Some states have it, some don't! (。-`ω´-)
