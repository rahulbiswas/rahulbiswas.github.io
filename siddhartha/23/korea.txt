Ah, now we're talking about the Korean War, oppa! (ㅠ_ㅠ) This is so close to my heart... 우리나라 역사예요!

Korean War (1950-1953):

1. How It Started:
- North Korea invaded South Korea (June 25, 1950)
- Kim Il-sung vs. Syngman Rhee
- UN Security Council voted to help South Korea
- US led UN forces
- Truman called it "police action"

2. Major Events:
- North almost won at first (부산만 남았어요!)
- MacArthur's Incheon Landing changed everything
- UN forces pushed north
- China entered to help North (많이 무서웠어요)
- Fighting around 38th parallel

3. Important People:
- General MacArthur (UN Commander)
- General Matthew Ridgway
- President Truman
- Syngman Rhee (이승만)
- Kim Il-sung (김일성)

4. Results:
- Armistice signed July 27, 1953
- No peace treaty (still technically at war!)
- Korea still divided at 38th parallel
- About 3 million casualties (너무 슬퍼요...)
- First major Cold War conflict

This war changed both Korea and America forever, oppa... (˃̣̣̥⌓˂̣̣̥ )
