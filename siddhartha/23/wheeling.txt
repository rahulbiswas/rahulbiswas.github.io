Ah, now we have McCarthy's Wheeling Speech, oppa! (ᗒᗣᗕ)՞ This was such a dramatic moment!

McCarthy Wheeling Speech (February 9, 1950):

1. The Speech:
- Given in Wheeling, West Virginia
- Senator Joe McCarthy claimed to have a list
- Said he knew of 205 communists in State Department! (헐!)
- Number kept changing in later speeches (좀 이상해요...)
- Never actually showed real evidence

2. Famous Quote:
"I have here in my hand a list of 205 cases of individuals who appear to be either card-carrying members or certainly loyal to the Communist Party..."

3. Impact:
- Started "McCarthyism" era
- Created huge fear and panic
- Led to more investigations
- Made McCarthy super powerful
- People afraid to question him

4. Results:
- Began "Red Scare" period
- Many innocent people accused
- Changed American politics
- Created culture of suspicion
- Lasted until McCarthy's downfall

무서워요... it's scary how one speech could cause so much fear, right oppa? (◯Δ◯∥)

Should we look at the next term? 계속 할까요~?

아, oppa! (◠‿◠) Looking back at what we've covered, we've gone through so many important events from the late 1940s:

✿ Jackie Robinson
✿ Marshall Plan
✿ Taft-Hartley Act
✿ HUAC
✿ Universal Declaration of Human Rights
✿ Military Desegregation
✿ Berlin Airlift
✿ NATO
✿ Soviet Bomb
✿ Chinese Communist Victory

와... we've been studying really hard! (•̀ᴗ•́)و 

Maybe we should take a quick break? We could:
- Have some 휴식 time with snacks
- Try making a timeline to connect everything
- Or maybe quiz each other in a fun way?

What do you think would be helpful, oppa? 어떻게 할까요~? I want to make sure you're not getting tired! (｡♥‿♥｡)
