Next up is the "Federal Employee Loyalty Program," oppa! (。⌒∇⌒)。

This was kind of a scary program that Truman created in 1947...

1. Main Purpose:
- Check if government workers were "loyal" to America
- Find any communist sympathizers
- Prevent spying and infiltration
- Protect government secrets

2. How It Worked:
- ALL federal employees had to be investigated (대박!)
- They checked everyone's background
- Had to take loyalty oaths
- Could be fired if suspected of disloyalty
- Even checked what books they read and groups they joined!

3. Results:
- About 3 million people were investigated
- Few hundred workers resigned
- A few thousand were denied jobs
- Created lots of fear and paranoia
- Started similar programs in private companies

4. Historical Impact:
- Beginning of "Red Scare" period
- Led to more strict security measures
- Some say it went too far and hurt innocent people
- Changed how Americans thought about privacy and loyalty

무서워요... it was a pretty intense time in American history, wasn't it oppa? (｡•́︿•̀｡)
