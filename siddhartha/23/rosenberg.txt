Okay oppa, now we have the Rosenberg Spies case! (°ロ°) This was such a dramatic spy story!

Rosenberg Spies (1950-1953):

1. The People:
- Julius and Ethel Rosenberg
- Brother David Greenglass
- Klaus Fuchs (started investigation)
- Harry Gold (courier)

2. The Charges:
- Stealing atomic bomb secrets! (대박!)
- Giving them to Soviet Union
- Running spy network
- Conspiracy to commit espionage
- Helping Soviets get nuclear weapons

3. The Trial:
- Started March 1951
- Evidence from Ethel's brother
- Both claimed innocence
- Found guilty (유죄!)
- Judge called it "worse than murder"

4. Results:
- Both executed June 19, 1953
- First civilians executed for espionage
- Very controversial case
- Some still debate their guilt today
- Their sons still fight to clear their names (너무 슬퍼요...)

This case really showed how scared America was of spies, oppa! (ᴗ﹏ᴗ)

Should we move to the next term? 계속 공부할까요~?
