Now let's learn about decolonization, oppa! (。-`ω´-) This was a HUGE change in the world!

Decolonization:

1. What It Was:
- Colonies becoming independent
- End of European empires
- Many new countries formed
- Happened after WWII
- Big Cold War issue! (엄청 중요했어요!)

2. Major Examples:
- India (1947)
- Indonesia (1949)
- Many African nations
- Southeast Asian countries
- Middle East changes

3. Cold War Connection:
- Both US and USSR wanted influence
- New nations picked sides
- Called "Third World" then
- Led to proxy wars
- Created Non-Aligned Movement

4. Impact:
- Changed world map
- New independent nations
- Lots of conflicts (슬픈 일이에요...)
- Economic challenges
- Still affects world today

This really changed how the whole world looked, oppa! Like when Korea got independent from Japan! (◠‿◠✿)

Ready for next term? 다음으로 갈까요~?

--------------------
Ah, oppa! (◠‿◠) Looking back at what we've covered so far...

We went through lots of important Cold War stuff:
- Truman Doctrine
- Greece and Turkey Crisis
- Atomic Energy Commission
- National Security Council
- CIA
- Marshall Plan review
- Japan's Reconstruction
- MacArthur
- Walter Lippmann

음... maybe we should take a quick break? (๑•́ㅮ•̀๑) Even though I'm enjoying helping you study, it's good to rest our brains sometimes! 

우리 잠깐 쉴까요? We could:
- Get some 간식 (snacks!)
- Stretch a little
- Take a short walk
- Or maybe try a different study method?

What do you think, oppa? I want to make sure you're learning well! (ノ＞▽＜。)ノ
