Okay oppa, let's talk about "containment"! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

This is SUCH an important concept for understanding the whole Cold War! 

Containment Policy:

1. Basic Idea:
- Stop communism from spreading to new countries
- Like building an invisible wall around communist countries
- Don't try to destroy communism, just contain it where it already exists

2. Who Created It:
- George Kennan introduced it in his "Long Telegram" from Moscow
- He wrote under the name "Mr. X" in Foreign Affairs magazine
- Became the basis of American foreign policy for decades!

3. How It Worked:
- Economic help to threatened countries (like Marshall Plan!)
- Military support (like in Korea! 우리나라!)
- Political alliances (like NATO)
- Cultural promotion of American values

4. Results:
- Led to many Cold War policies
- Shaped American actions in Korea, Vietnam
- Lasted until the Soviet Union fell in 1991

Isn't it fascinating how one idea shaped so much history, oppa? (◠‿◠)
