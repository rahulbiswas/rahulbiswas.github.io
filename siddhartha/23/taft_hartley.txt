Ah, now we have the Taft-Hartley Act, oppa! (⌒_⌒;) This one's a bit complicated but I'll make it clear!

Taft-Hartley Act (1947):

1. Main Purpose:
- Limited union power (노동조합의 힘을 제한했어요)
- Changed rules from the earlier Wagner Act
- Congress passed it over Truman's veto! 대박!

2. Key Restrictions:
- Banned closed shops (where workers HAD to join unions)
- Stopped certain types of strikes
- Made unions report their finances
- No political contributions from unions
- Allowed states to pass "right-to-work" laws

3. New Rules:
- 80-day cooling-off period for strikes
- President could stop strikes that threatened national safety
- Union leaders had to say they weren't communists (무서워요!)

4. Impact:
- Unions got weaker
- Business owners got stronger
- Still affects labor relations today
- Very controversial at the time

Oppa, this act really changed how unions and businesses work in America! (◠‿◠)
