        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>In Meyer v. Nebraska, the Supreme Court struck down a Nebraska law prohibiting the teaching of foreign languages to young children. The Court ruled that the law violated the 14th Amendment's due process clause, protecting teachers' right to teach and parents' right to control their children's education. This decision limited states' power to restrict educational and cultural rights.</explanation>
