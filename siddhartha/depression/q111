        <explanation>Meyer v. Nebraska (1923) significantly advanced civil liberties by protecting educational and cultural rights. The Supreme Court ruled that states could not prohibit the teaching of foreign languages, establishing that the 14th Amendment's due process clause protected teachers' rights to teach and parents' rights to control their children's education. This decision limited states' power to restrict cultural and educational freedoms.</explanation>
