        <explanation>Harding's "return to normalcy" policy included higher tariffs (Fordney-McCumber Tariff) and strict immigration restrictions, reflecting a desire to return to pre-World War I isolationism. This approach emphasized reducing government's role in the economy, restricting immigration through quotas, and promoting business interests. The policy marked a sharp break from the Progressive Era's reform agenda.</explanation>
