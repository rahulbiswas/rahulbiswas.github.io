        <explanation>The 1919 Schenck v. United States decision established the "clear and present danger" test for limiting free speech. Justice Holmes ruled that speech creating a clear and present danger of substantive evils could be restricted, using the famous example that falsely shouting "fire" in a crowded theater was not protected speech. This decision established important limits on First Amendment protections during national security crises.</explanation>
