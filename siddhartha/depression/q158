        <explanation>U.S. policy in Nicaragua during the 1920s involved direct military occupation and financial control. The presence of U.S. Marines (1912-1933) and control over Nicaragua's finances demonstrated the continuation of "dollar diplomacy" and military intervention. This policy sparked nationalist resistance, particularly from Augusto Sandino's guerrilla movement, and led to the later establishment of the Somoza dictatorship.</explanation>
