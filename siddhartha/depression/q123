        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The 1919 Schenck decision significantly limited free speech during wartime by establishing the "clear and present danger" test. Justice Holmes ruled that speech creating a clear and present danger of substantive evils could be restricted, using the famous example that falsely shouting "fire" in a crowded theater was not protected speech. This decision established important limits on First Amendment protections during national security crises.</explanation>
