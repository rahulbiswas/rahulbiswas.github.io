        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>In Olmstead v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that wiretapping without a warrant did not violate the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches because there was no physical intrusion into private property. This decision, which stood until 1967, gave law enforcement significant latitude in conducting electronic surveillance, particularly during Prohibition enforcement.</explanation>
