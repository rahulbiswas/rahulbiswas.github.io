        <explanation>While the Indian Citizenship Act granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans born within U.S. territory, its practical impact was severely limited by state-level restrictions on voting rights. Many states continued to deny Native Americans the right to vote through various measures including literacy tests, poll taxes, and other discriminatory practices. Full voting rights were not achieved in all states until the 1950s.</explanation>
