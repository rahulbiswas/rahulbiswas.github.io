        <explanation>U.S. policy in Nicaragua during the 1920s exemplified military intervention and financial control in Latin America. The presence of U.S. Marines (1912-1933), control over Nicaragua's finances, and support for pro-American leaders demonstrated the continued implementation of "dollar diplomacy" and military intervention. This policy sparked nationalist resistance, particularly from Augusto Sandino's guerrilla movement.</explanation>
