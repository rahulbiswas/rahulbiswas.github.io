        <explanation>Warren G. Harding's presidency (1921-1923) was characterized by multiple corruption scandals, most notably the Teapot Dome scandal. His administration's "return to normalcy" policy favored business interests and reduced government regulation, but was tarnished by the criminal behavior of his appointees, including Interior Secretary Albert Fall and Attorney General Harry Daugherty, making his presidency remembered primarily for corruption and scandal.</explanation>
