        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The RFC, established in 1932, exemplified Hoover's approach to fighting the Depression through indirect aid. Rather than providing direct relief to individuals, it made loans to banks, railroads, and other businesses, reflecting Hoover's belief that helping financial institutions would eventually benefit the broader economy through a "trickle-down" effect. This approach proved inadequate for addressing the Depression's severity.</explanation>
