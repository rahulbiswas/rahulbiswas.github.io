        <explanation>The Wickersham Commission's 1931 report revealed widespread problems with Prohibition enforcement, including corruption, increased crime, and public resistance.

This contradictory position reflected the growing recognition of Prohibition's failure while maintaining official support for the policy.</explanation>
