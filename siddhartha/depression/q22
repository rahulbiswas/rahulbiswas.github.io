        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans born within U.S. territory. While this represented a significant change in federal Indian policy, it did not automatically guarantee voting rights, which remained under state control. Many states continued to deny Native Americans voting rights through various restrictions until the 1950s.</explanation>
