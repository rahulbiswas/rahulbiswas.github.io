        <explanation>United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind (1923) challenged the racial definition of "white" for citizenship eligibility. Though Indians were technically classified as Caucasian, the Supreme Court ruled they were not "white" in the common understanding and thus ineligible for naturalized citizenship. This decision reflected the period's racial prejudices and further restricted Asian immigration and citizenship rights.</explanation>
