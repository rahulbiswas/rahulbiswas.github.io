        <explanation>While the Indian Citizenship Act granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans born within U.S. territory, its practical impact was limited by state-level restrictions on voting rights. Many states continued to deny Native Americans voting rights through various measures such as literacy tests, poll taxes, and other discriminatory practices. Full voting rights for Native Americans were not achieved in all states until the 1950s.</explanation>
