        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>In Olmstead v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that wiretapping without a warrant did not violate the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Court held that wiretaps did not constitute a physical invasion of property and therefore were not "searches." This decision shaped privacy rights and law enforcement practices during Prohibition, though it was later overturned in 1967.</explanation>
