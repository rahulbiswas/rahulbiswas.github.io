        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Hoover's belief in "American Individualism," which emphasized voluntary cooperation and limited government intervention, proved inadequate in face of the Great Depression's unprecedented severity. His ideological commitment to self-reliance and opposition to direct federal aid conflicted with the reality that private charity and local efforts alone could not address the crisis's massive scale.</explanation>
