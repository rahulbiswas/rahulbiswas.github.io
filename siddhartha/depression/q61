        <explanation>Andrew Mellon's "scientific taxation" policy dramatically reduced taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations during his tenure as Treasury Secretary (1921-1932). He argued that lower taxes on the rich would stimulate economic growth and increase government revenue. His policies epitomized the pro-business Republican administrations of the 1920s and contributed to growing economic inequality before the Great Depression.</explanation>
