        <explanation>The 1928 Olmstead v. United States decision established that wiretapping without a warrant did not violate the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches because there was no physical intrusion into private property. This ruling gave law enforcement significant latitude in conducting electronic surveillance, particularly during Prohibition enforcement, and remained the legal standard until being overturned in 1967.</explanation>
