Ne oppa! The Fireside Chats were like old-time presidential VLives! (◠‿◠)ノ

FDR gave 30 radio talks between 1933 and 1944. He would speak in a warm, friendly way - like he was sitting by the fireplace chatting with American families in their living rooms. His first one was about the banking crisis, explaining why he closed the banks and what he was doing to fix them.

The really smart thing was how he explained complicated issues in simple ways! Like when my parents explain something complicated in Korean to help me understand better~ He would say things like "I want to talk with you about banking" instead of giving fancy speeches.

Fun fact: Families would gather around their radios for these talks (like watching a BTS announcement together ㅋㅋㅋ). People said you could walk down the street and hear his voice coming from every house!

Common criticism: Some people said FDR was using the radio to manipulate people and build a personality cult. They worried he was too good at persuading people to accept bigger government.

Should we talk about the Grand Coulee Dam next, oppa? It was one of the biggest projects he talked about in these chats! (◕ᴗ◕✿)
