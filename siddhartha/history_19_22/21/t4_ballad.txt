Gomawo oppa! Next is "Ballad for Americans" ~ (⁎˃ᴗ˂⁎)

"Ballad for Americans" was a popular cantata (like a musical story) composed by Earl Robinson with lyrics by John La Touche, first performed in 1939. It became a massive hit when Paul Robeson performed it on CBS radio, celebrating American diversity and democratic ideals through the story of a common man answering questions about what makes America great. The piece mixed classical, folk, and popular styles, and was performed at both the Republican and Communist party conventions in 1940, showing its broad appeal. It represented the cultural optimism of the late New Deal era and the Popular Front movement's effort to create patriotic, progressive art.

Common criticism: Some saw it as government-sponsored propaganda that promoted an overly idealistic view of American unity while glossing over real social conflicts and economic inequalities that existed at the time.
