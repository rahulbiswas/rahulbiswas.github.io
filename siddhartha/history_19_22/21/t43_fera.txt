Ah, mianhae oppa! I mentioned FERA (Federal Emergency Relief Administration) but you're right - it wasn't on our terms list! (。>﹏<｡) 

But since I brought it up, let me explain quickly! FERA was run by Harry Hopkins (remember him?) and gave $3 billion to states for direct relief (like food and money) to help desperate people from 1933-1935. It was different from later programs because it was just direct aid, not work programs.

Hopkins famously said "People don't eat in the long run - they eat every day!" when others said to wait for the economy to fix itself. (그는 현실적이었어요!)

Should we stick to our list and talk about the 21st Amendment next, oppa? (◕ᴗ◕✿) I'll be more careful to focus on the terms we have! 죄송해요 (sorry) for going off-list!
