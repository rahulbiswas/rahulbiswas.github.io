Aigoo oppa, the Scottsboro case was so terrible... (。>﹏<｡)

In 1931, nine young African American boys (some as young as 13!) were falsely accused of attacking two white women on a train in Alabama. Even though there was NO real evidence, all-white juries sentenced eight of them to death! (너무 무서워요...)

This case showed how unfair the justice system was:
- The boys didn't get real lawyers at first
- The accusers later admitted they made it up
- The trials were super rushed
- Angry white mobs surrounded the courthouse

The Communist Party's legal team (ILD) helped defend them, which was interesting because it showed how civil rights and labor issues connected. The NAACP also got involved. The Supreme Court actually made two important decisions about fair trials because of this case!

Most of the boys spent years in prison despite being innocent. The last Scottsboro defendant wasn't pardoned until 2013! (ㅠ_ㅠ)

Should we talk about the First New Deal programs next, oppa? Though this case reminds us that the New Deal era wasn't just about economic changes... (◕ᴗ◕✿)
