Ne oppa! The Court Packing controversy was a big oopsie in FDR's presidency! (◎_◎;)

After winning big in 1936, FDR got really frustrated because the Supreme Court kept striking down New Deal programs like the NRA and first AAA. So in 1937, he announced a plan to add up to six new justices to the Court (one for each justice over age 70½). While he claimed this was to help the overworked elderly justices, everyone knew he really wanted to add judges who would support his programs! (｡•́︿•̀｡)

Even many Democrats thought this went too far - it looked like he was trying to control another branch of government! The plan failed badly and hurt FDR's reputation. Ironically, around the same time, the Court started upholding New Deal programs anyway (called "the switch in time that saved nine" ㅋㅋㅋ).

Common criticism: This was seen as a dangerous power grab that threatened the Constitution's separation of powers, and it showed FDR's tendency toward executive overreach when he didn't get his way.
