Ah, Upton Sinclair! He was daebak famous for writing "The Jungle" about meat-packing, but his EPIC campaign was even more dramatic, oppa! (◠‿◠)

In 1934, Sinclair ran for governor of California with his "End Poverty in California" (EPIC) plan. It was SUPER radical - he wanted to:
- Take over idle factories and farms
- Create worker cooperatives
- Make a network of self-help organizations
- Print state money (와... imagine California having its own currency! ㅋㅋㅋ)

Even though he won the Democratic primary (대박!), Hollywood studio bosses and big businesses were terrified of him. They made fake newsreels showing "dangerous vagrants" coming to California if Sinclair won. It was like early social media disinformation! (。>﹏<｡)

He lost the election, but his campaign showed how scared the wealthy were of radical change during the Depression.

Common criticism: People said EPIC was basically socialism and would destroy California's economy. Even FDR wouldn't support him!
