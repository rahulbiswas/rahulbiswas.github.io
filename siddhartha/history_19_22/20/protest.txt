Protest and Reform Movements 1920-1932

The Bonus Army March represented a defining moment of the Hoover presidency in 1932. Nearly 20,000 World War I veterans, accompanied by their families, marched on Washington DC demanding early payment of their service bonuses. These veterans, already suffering from the Depression, established a massive encampment at Anacostia Flats that became a symbol of economic desperation. Hoover's response proved disastrous - he ordered General MacArthur to clear the camps, resulting in violent confrontations that left two veterans dead. The sight of U.S. troops attacking former soldiers shocked the nation and severely damaged Hoover's reputation.

Agricultural protest movements gained significant momentum as farm conditions deteriorated. Milo Reno emerged as a powerful leader, organizing the Farmers' Holiday Association which coordinated direct action protests. Farmers engaged in milk strikes, blocked markets, and physically prevented farm foreclosures. The movement pushed hard for the McNary-Haugen Bill, which would have provided federal price supports, but faced repeated vetoes. Cooperative movements grew as farmers sought collective solutions, while mortgage moratoriums were demanded at the state level.

Labor activism intensified as working conditions worsened during the Depression. Major strikes erupted in textile mills, coal mines, and railroads. Workers fought against wage cuts and for union recognition, often facing violent opposition from police and private security forces. Communist influence in some unions led to anti-radical campaigns that complicated organizing efforts. Strike breakers and court injunctions were commonly used to defeat labor actions.

The civil rights movement saw important developments through NAACP growth and activism. Anti-lynching campaigns gained national attention while legal challenges targeted discrimination in housing, employment, and public accommodations. The NAACP's legal defense program laid groundwork for future court victories. Race riots and violence remained serious concerns, prompting organized responses from African American communities.

Women's rights advocacy continued after suffrage through new channels. The Equal Rights Amendment was first proposed, while birth control advocates challenged restrictive laws. Women pushed for expanded professional and educational opportunities, property rights, and workplace protections. Marriage reform and economic rights remained key issues as women's roles in society continued evolving.

Progressive reform efforts addressed multiple areas of American life. Anti-corruption campaigns targeted political machines while promoting civil service reform and clean government. Social welfare advocates pushed for public health programs, child labor laws, and better working conditions. Conservation movements expanded national parks and forest preservation. Mexican-American communities organized to protect citizenship rights and combat discrimination.

The anti-Prohibition movement gained strength as problems with enforcement became clear. Arguments focused on civil liberties violations, enforcement corruption, and economic costs. State and local governments struggled with implementation while public opinion gradually shifted toward repeal. The movement successfully connected Prohibition's failures to broader reform needs in law enforcement and criminal justice.
