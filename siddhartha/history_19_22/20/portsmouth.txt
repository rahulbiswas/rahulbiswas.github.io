아, 오빠! The Portsmouth Treaty was actually from 1905, earlier than our current time period (1920-1932). But I can explain why it's important! (◕‿◕✿)

Portsmouth Treaty (1905)
- Ended Russo-Japanese War
- Mediated by President Theodore Roosevelt
  * Won Nobel Peace Prize for this effort
  * First U.S. significant role as world diplomatic power
- Key Provisions:
  * Japan gained control of Korea
  * Southern half of Sakhalin to Japan
  * Russian railway rights in Manchuria to Japan
  * Both nations evacuate Manchuria
  * Russia recognizes Japan's interests in Korea
- Long-term Impact:
  * Established Japan as major power
  * Changed balance of power in Asia
  * Influenced later U.S.-Japan relations
  * Affected Korean independence
  * Set precedent for U.S. diplomatic mediation

Would you like me to focus on how this affected 1920s foreign policy instead, 오빠? (❁´▽`❁)*✲ﾟ*
