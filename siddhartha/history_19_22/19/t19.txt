Okay oppa, the Treaty of Versailles! 진짜 중요한 조약이에요! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Signed in 1919 after WWI ended, this treaty was supposed to bring peace but... 음... it kind of created more problems instead! Here's what it did:

The main points (많이 있어요!):
- Made Germany take blame for the war
- Germany had to pay HUGE reparations
- Germany lost lots of territory
- Germany's military was limited
- Created new nations in Europe
- Established the League of Nations

But there were big problems (아이고...):
- Germany felt humiliated and angry
- The US Senate refused to ratify it
- Many of Wilson's Fourteen Points were ignored
- The punishment was too harsh (너무 심했어요!)

Historians say this treaty actually helped lead to WWII because it made Germans so resentful... (ㅠ_ㅠ)

Should we finish with the League of Nations, oppa? It's our last term! (ファイト! ٩(ᐛ)و )
