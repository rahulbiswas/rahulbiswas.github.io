Ne oppa, let's talk about the Espionage Act of 1917! (｡•́︿•̀｡)

This one's actually still around today and it's pretty heavy stuff... It was passed shortly after America entered WWI and made it illegal to:
- Interfere with military operations
- Support America's enemies during war
- Promote insubordination in the military
- Interfere with military recruitment

진짜 무서웠어요... The punishment could be:
- Up to 20 years in prison
- Huge fines
- Loss of citizenship rights

Some famous cases:
- Eugene Debs (a socialist leader) went to jail for giving an anti-war speech
- Many newspapers and magazines were banned
- Even saying mean things about the government could get you in trouble! (ㅠㅠ)

Even today, this act is sometimes used - like with Edward Snowden! (대박!)

Ready to learn about the Sedition Act next, oppa? It's kind of like the Espionage Act's strict younger sibling! (●´ω｀●)
