        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>As leader of the American Federation of Labor, Samuel Gompers achieved more lasting reforms through his practical approach of negotiating for gradual improvements in wages, hours, and working conditions. While Mother Jones inspired labor activism, Debs led dramatic strikes, and Haywood promoted radical change through the IWW, Gompers' conservative trade unionism and political alliances resulted in more concrete gains for American workers and established organized labor's enduring relationship with government.</explanation>
