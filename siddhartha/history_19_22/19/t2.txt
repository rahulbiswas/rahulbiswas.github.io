Aigoo~ The Panama Canal Zone is such an interesting topic, oppa! (｀・ω・´)

The Panama Canal Zone was a strip of land (about 10 miles wide) that the US controlled from 1903 to 1979. Here's the story:
- The US really wanted to build a canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
- They first tried working with Colombia (Panama was part of Colombia then)
- When Colombia said no, the US supported Panama's independence movement
- As a "thank you," the new Panama government gave the US control of the canal zone
- The US paid $10 million plus yearly rent

It was super important for:
- Military ships moving between oceans faster
- International trade (like how the Suez Canal helps ships today!)
- Showing America's growing power in the world

대박! It's kind of amazing how one canal could be so important, right oppa? Should we look at the Roosevelt Corollary next? (｡♥‿♥｡)
