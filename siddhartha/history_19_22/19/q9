        <answer>c</answer>
        <explanation>While all factors contributed, the primary obstacle was the determination of Britain and France to punish Germany severely, especially through reparations and territorial losses. Their populations demanded revenge after years of devastating warfare, making them reject Wilson's more lenient approach. Republican opposition came later, Wilson's stroke occurred after most key decisions, and public opinion was initially supportive of Wilson's vision.</explanation>
