        <explanation>The Espionage Act of 1917, followed by the Sedition Act of 1918, severely restricted civil liberties by making it illegal to criticize the war effort, oppose military recruitment, or express pro-German sentiments. The Supreme Court upheld these restrictions in cases like Schenck v. United States, establishing the "clear and present danger" test for limiting free speech during wartime.</explanation>
