Ne oppa, let's talk about Marcus Garvey! (◠‿◠✿)

He was a really interesting leader who had different ideas from other civil rights activists at the time. Born in Jamaica, he created the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in the 1920s.

His main ideas were (와~ 대단해요):
- Black Pride and Self-Reliance
- "Back to Africa" movement
- Creating black-owned businesses
- Pan-African unity (all black people worldwide working together!)

He even started:
- A shipping company (Black Star Line)
- Newspapers
- Stores and businesses
- The UNIA had millions of members! (진짜 인기 많았어요!)

But... things got complicated (아이고...):
- The government didn't like his ideas
- He was arrested for mail fraud
- Eventually deported back to Jamaica
- But his ideas about black pride and self-reliance influenced later movements!

Should we talk about the Red Scare next, oppa? That was a really scary time in American history! (°ロ°)
