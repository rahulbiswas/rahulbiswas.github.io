        <explanation>Through Hull House and similar settlement houses, Jane Addams created a model for urban reform that addressed multiple social issues simultaneously - poverty, education, sanitation, child labor, and immigrant rights. While La Follette focused on state-level reforms in Wisconsin, Tom Johnson on Cleveland city government, and Hiram Johnson on California state politics, Addams's settlement house movement had the broadest impact on progressive reform at the neighborhood and city level across America.</explanation>
