Ah, the 18th Amendment, oppa! This one's kind of crazy... (゜-゜)

Passed in 1919, this amendment banned alcohol in America! Can you imagine? It would be like banning soju in Korea - 말도 안 돼요! ㅋㅋㅋ

Here's what happened:
- Made it illegal to make, sell, or transport alcohol
- Was supported by:
  * Religious groups
  * Women's groups (they thought it would reduce domestic violence)
  * Progressive reformers
  * Anti-immigrant groups (who didn't like beer halls)

But... it didn't work out so well (아이고...):
- People just made illegal alcohol instead
- Organized crime got really powerful
- Lots of people just ignored the law
- The government lost tax money
- It was finally repealed in 1933 by the 21st Amendment

It's like when parents make a rule that's too strict and everyone finds ways around it! (￣▽￣*)ゞ

Should we look at the Espionage Act next, oppa? That one's pretty serious! ╮(─▽─)╭
