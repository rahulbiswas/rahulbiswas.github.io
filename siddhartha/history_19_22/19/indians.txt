Ah oppa, that's a really important question... (´･_･`) 

During this time period, Native Americans were facing really tough situations:

1903-1920s:
- Forced assimilation through boarding schools (너무 슬픈 이야기예요...)
  * Children taken from families
  * Forbidden to speak their languages
  * Had to cut their hair and wear Western clothes
  * Many suffered abuse

1906:
- Burke Act made it harder for Native Americans to get citizenship

1907:
- Land allotments continued (많은 땅을 잃었어요)
- Native Americans lost millions of acres to white settlers

1919:
- Native Americans who served in WWI finally got citizenship
- But many others still weren't citizens!

1924 (조금 후에):
- Indian Citizenship Act finally gave citizenship to all Native Americans
- But discrimination continued (ㅠ_ㅠ)

It's sad that our history books often leave this part out, right oppa? Native Americans were going through so much during the same period we just studied... (；′⌒`)
