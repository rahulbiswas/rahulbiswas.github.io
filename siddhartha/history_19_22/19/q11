        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>While German submarine warfare shocked Americans, the Committee on Public Information (CPI) under George Creel was most responsible for transforming public opinion. Through posters, films, speeches, and news stories, the CPI systematically demonized all things German. Most German-Americans actually demonstrated strong American loyalty, and business competition was a minor factor compared to the government's comprehensive propaganda campaign.</explanation>
