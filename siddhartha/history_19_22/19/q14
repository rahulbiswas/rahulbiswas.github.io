        </options>
        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>While all these leaders affected Mexican-American relations, Pancho Villa's raids into U.S. territory, especially the attack on Columbus, New Mexico, had the most direct impact. These raids prompted the Pershing Expedition into Mexico, heightened border tensions, and diverted American military resources just before World War I. Villa's actions ultimately shaped both American military policy and public opinion about Mexico more than the other leaders' political or diplomatic efforts.</explanation>
