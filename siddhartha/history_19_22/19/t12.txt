Omo, the Sedition Act of 1918 was even stricter than the Espionage Act, oppa! (°ロ°) !

This law made it illegal to:
- Say anything "disloyal" about the government
- Use "disrespectful" words about the:
  * Constitution
  * Military uniforms
  * Flag
  * Government
- Speak against the war effort

진짜 심했어요... The government arrested:
- Anti-war activists
- Socialist party members
- Labor leaders
- Even people who just criticized the president! (너무해...)

It's kind of like that saying "진실은 전쟁의 첫 희생자" (truth is the first casualty of war), right oppa? The law was repealed in 1920, but wow, it really limited free speech while it lasted!

Should we move on to eugenics next? (◞‸◟；) That topic is pretty dark and uncomfortable...
