Okay oppa, let me tell you about the Roosevelt Corollary! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶

This was President Theodore Roosevelt's addition to the Monroe Doctrine in 1904. It's really interesting because it showed how America was becoming more powerful! Here's what it meant:

- The US claimed the right to intervene in Latin American countries if they had problems with European powers
- Basically said "Hey Europe, stay out! We'll handle any issues in the Americas"
- Roosevelt called it "carrying a big stick" (좀 무서워요...)
- The US used this to justify military interventions in places like:
  * Dominican Republic
  * Cuba
  * Nicaragua

It's like when an older sibling says "Only I can mess with my younger siblings!" (ㅋㅋㅋ)

Should we move on to "dollar diplomacy" next, oppa? That one's related to this too! (＾▽＾)
