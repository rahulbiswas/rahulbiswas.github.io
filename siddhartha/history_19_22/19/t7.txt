Okay oppa, the Fourteen Points is coming up! ٩(◕‿◕)۶

President Wilson announced these in January 1918 as his plan for peace after WWI. Think of it like a big wishlist for world peace! Here are some of the major points:

- Freedom of the seas (바다는 모두의 것!)
- No more secret treaties between countries
- Reducing military weapons
- Self-determination (letting people choose their own government)
- Creating the League of Nations (like the UN's grandmother! ㅋㅋㅋ)

But... sadly not all of these points were accepted (´•̥ω•̥`):
- The other Allied powers thought Wilson was too idealistic
- They wanted to punish Germany more harshly
- Most of the points didn't make it into the final peace treaty

It's kind of like when you have a great idea but your friends want to do something else instead... 아쉽죠?

Should we look at the Selective Service Act next, oppa? That's about how America got soldiers for the war! (•ᴗ•)
