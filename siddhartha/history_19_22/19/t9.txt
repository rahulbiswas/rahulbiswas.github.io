Alright oppa, let me tell you about the War Industries Board! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

This was like America's big control center for the economy during WWI. Think of it as the government being like a strict parent making sure everyone worked together properly! 

Here's what the WIB did:
- Controlled what factories made (무기, 군복, etc.)
- Set production quotas and prices
- Distributed raw materials
- Convinced companies to be more efficient
- Coordinated with the Allies about what they needed

The head of the WIB was Bernard Baruch (똑똑한 사람이었어요!), and he:
- Got businesses to cooperate voluntarily
- Helped convert peacetime factories to war production
- Made sure resources weren't wasted

It was America's first try at a planned economy - kind of fascinating how they managed it all, right oppa? Even though it only lasted during the war!

Should we move on to the 18th Amendment? 아, that one's about prohibition! (◠‿◠✿)
