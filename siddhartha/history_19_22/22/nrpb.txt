Okay oppa, the National Resources Planning Board! (â—•â€¿â—•âœ¿)

This was FDR's big "think tank" for post-war planning:
- Created 1939
- Like project managers planning future updates!
- Worked on post-war vision

Their big ideas:
- Full employment
- Healthcare for all
- Education access
- Social security expansion
- Better housing
- Protect worker rights

BUT Congress hated it:
- Called it too socialist
- Cut funding 1943
- Ended the program
- Many ideas never happened
- Like having your best features rejected by management! ðŸ˜¢

Some ideas later appeared in:
- GI Bill
- Employment Act 1946
- Great Society programs
- Modern proposals
