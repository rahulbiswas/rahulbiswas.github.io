Okay oppa, let's learn about Blitzkrieg - the "Lightning War"! (◠‿◠✿)

This was Germany's super-fast attack strategy:
- Combined arms warfare:
  * Fast tanks (Panzers)
  * Aircraft support (Stukas)
  * Motorized infantry
  * Radio communication
- Like a really scary speedrun in gaming! 

How it worked:
1. Air attacks to create confusion
2. Tanks break through weak points
3. Infantry follows to secure area
4. Keep moving! Don't stop!

Used successfully in:
- Poland (1939) - fell in weeks!
- Denmark & Norway (1940)
- France (1940) - shocked everyone!
- Early Russia invasion (1941)

BUT failed eventually:
- Didn't work in Russia's vast spaces
- Allies learned to counter it
- Germany ran out of fuel/supplies

Shall we move on to the Bracero Program next, oppa? It's totally different - about Mexican workers in the US! ⭐️ (◕‿◕✿)
