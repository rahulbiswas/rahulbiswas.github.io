Okay oppa, let's talk about Gandhi during WW2! (◕‿◕✿)

His position was complicated:
- Opposed fascism/Nazis
- BUT also opposed British rule
- Launched "Quit India" movement (1942)
  * Wanted British out
  * Peaceful protests
  * "Do or Die" speech

British response:
- Arrested Gandhi
- Jailed Congress leaders
- Said wait until war ends
- Kept control of India

Gandhi's ideas:
- Non-violent resistance
- Indians shouldn't fight British wars
- BUT also said:
  * Don't help Japan
  * Opposed violence
  * Wanted peaceful freedom

Results:
- Spent war years in jail
- Released 1944
- Led independence talks
- India got freedom 1947
- Sadly killed 1948 😢
