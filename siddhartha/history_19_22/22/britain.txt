Okay oppa, let's talk about the Battle of Britain! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

This was such a crucial air battle in 1940:
- First major campaign fought entirely by air forces
- Hitler needed to defeat RAF (Royal Air Force) before invading Britain
- Lasted from July to October 1940

Key points:
- German Luftwaffe bombed:
  * RAF airfields
  * Radar stations
  * Later switched to bombing London (big mistake!)
- British advantages:
  * Radar early warning system
  * Fighting over home territory
  * Amazing Spitfire planes
  * Dedicated pilots ("The Few")

The result:
- Britain survived! First major German defeat!
- Churchill's famous quote: "Never was so much owed by so many to so few"
- Convinced Hitler to cancel invasion plans
- Showed Air Power could defend a nation! ⭐️

Ready for the Battle of Leyte Gulf next, oppa? (◠‿◠✿)
