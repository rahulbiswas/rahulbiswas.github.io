Okay oppa, Frank Dixon was a tricky character in wartime politics! (◕‿◕✿)

He was:
- Governor of Alabama (1939-1943)
- Opposed civil rights
- Against New Deal programs
- BUT supported war effort

What he did:
- Fought against FEPC
- Tried to keep voting whites-only
- Resisted federal control
- BUT helped military training in Alabama

Why he matters:
- Shows southern resistance to change
- Example of wartime contradictions:
  * Supported war effort
  * But fought racial progress
  * Like a program that works but has serious bugs!

Kind of represents the South during WW2:
- Patriotic about war
- But wouldn't change racial policies
- Created problems for war production

Should we move on to Fulgencio Batista next, oppa? He was Cuba's leader during WW2! (◠‿◠✿)
