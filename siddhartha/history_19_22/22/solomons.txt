Okay oppa, the Battle of the Solomons was a really long campaign! (◕‿◕✿)

August 1942 - February 1943:
- First major Allied offensive in Pacific
- Focused on Guadalcanal island and surrounding seas
- Super intense fighting on:
  * Land (US Marines vs Japanese Army)
  * Sea (lots of night naval battles!)
  * Air (daily combat over Henderson Field)

Key points:
- Started with US Marines landing on Guadalcanal
- Japanese tried to send in reinforcements at night ("Tokyo Express")
- Both sides lost lots of ships and planes
- Terrible conditions:
  * Disease
  * Jungle warfare
  * Limited supplies

Results:
- First time Japanese were pushed back!
- Showed US could win long, tough campaigns
- Protected supply lines to Australia
- Major confidence boost for Allies! ⭐️

Should we move on to Battle of the Bulge, oppa? It's quite different - takes us to Europe! (◠‿◠✿)
