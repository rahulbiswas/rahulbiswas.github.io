Okay oppa, the Death of FDR - such a dramatic moment! (â—•â€¿â—•âœ¿)

April 12, 1945:
- At Little White House (Georgia)
- Having portrait painted
- Sudden brain hemorrhage
- Like system crash at critical moment!

Timing was crucial:
- War almost won in Europe
- Planning Japan's defeat
- UN being created
- Post-war world forming
- But FDR never saw victory ðŸ˜¢

Impact huge:
- Nation shocked
- Truman took over
  * Never briefed on atomic bomb!
  * Had to learn everything fast
  * Like new admin with no training!
- Allies worried
- Stalin happy (thought Truman weaker)

Changes after:
- Different atomic bomb decision
- Harder line with USSR
- New domestic policies
- Changed course of history!
