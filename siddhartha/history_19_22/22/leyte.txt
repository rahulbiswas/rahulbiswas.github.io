Alright oppa, the Battle of Leyte Gulf was HUGE! (◕‿◕✿)

October 23-26, 1944 - the largest naval battle of WW2!
- Location: Philippines
- Part of MacArthur's "I shall return" campaign

The battle had multiple parts:
1. Surigao Strait
  * Last battleship-vs-battleship fight in history!
2. Samar
  * Small US ships faced giant Japanese fleet
  * Famous "tin can" destroyers saved the day!
3. Cape Engaño
  * US carriers defeated Japanese decoy fleet

Results:
- Destroyed Japanese navy's fighting power
- Protected MacArthur's landing in Philippines
- Japan couldn't move forces between home and conquered territories anymore
- Basically ended Japan's naval threat! 

Think of it like a massive system crash for Japan's naval power, oppa! ⭐️

Should we move on to the Battle of Midway Island? (◠‿◠)
