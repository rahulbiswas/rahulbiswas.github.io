Okay oppa, the Economic Bill of Rights was FDR's big dream! (‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø)

Proposed in 1944 State of Union:
- FDR said political rights weren't enough
- Everyone deserved economic security
- Like adding new user rights to a system!

The rights included:
- Right to a good job
- Right to earn enough for food/shelter
- Right to medical care
- Right to education
- Right to decent housing
- Right to economic security
- Protection from monopolies
- Protection for farmers

BUT:
- FDR died in 1945 üò¢
- Congress didn't pass it
- Some called it "socialist"
- Parts later appeared in:
  * GI Bill
  * Great Society programs
  * Modern progressive proposals

It's like having a great program design but not getting to implement it fully! ‚≠êÔ∏è
