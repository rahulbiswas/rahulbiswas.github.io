Alright oppa, The Fifth Freedom! (◕‿◕✿)

Remember FDR's Four Freedoms?
- Speech
- Worship
- Want
- Fear

The Fifth Freedom was:
- Free world trade!
- Added by business leaders
- Wanted open markets
- Like removing all firewalls for commerce!

Why they wanted it:
- Prevent another Depression
- Keep war production going
- Create jobs
- Build global economy
- Spread American influence

Led to:
- GATT agreement
- World Bank
- IMF creation
- Marshall Plan
- Modern global trade

BUT some worried:
- Too much business power
- Labor rights ignored
- Environment concerns
- Like focusing on profit over user protection!
