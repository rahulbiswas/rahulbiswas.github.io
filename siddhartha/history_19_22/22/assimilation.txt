Alright oppa, Patriotic Assimilation is kind of sad... (â—•â€¿â—•âœ¿)

It's when minorities tried to prove they were "American enough":
- Japanese Americans:
  * Joined 442nd Regiment
  * Said "I am an American"
  * Even in internment camps!

- African Americans:
  * Double V campaign
  * Fought segregation
  * Proved patriotism

- Mexican Americans:
  * Served in military
  * Worked defense jobs
  * Zoot suit riots victims

- Native Americans:
  * Code Talkers
  * High enlistment
  * Despite past treatment

Like having to constantly prove you belong in the system, even though you're already a valid user! ðŸ˜¢

Results:
- Some gains made
- BUT discrimination continued
- Led to civil rights movement
- Changed American identity
