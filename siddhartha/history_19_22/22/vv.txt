Alright oppa, the Double V Campaign was so clever! (◕‿◕✿)

Started in 1942 by Pittsburgh Courier (Black newspaper):
- V for Victory over fascism abroad
- V for Victory over racism at home
- Slogan: "Democracy: At Home—Abroad"

Goals:
- Support war effort
- Fight discrimination
- End segregation in military
- Get defense industry jobs
- Show patriotism AND protest

Impact:
- United Black community
- Increased civil rights activism
- Pressured government
- Led to some changes:
  * More defense jobs
  * FEPC created
  * Black military units proved themselves
  * Set stage for post-war civil rights

Think of it like debugging two problems at once - fighting enemies overseas AND inequality at home! ⭐️

Should we learn about Dresden next, oppa? It's about Allied bombing in Germany. (◠‿◠✿)
