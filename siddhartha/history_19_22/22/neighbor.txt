Okay oppa, the Good Neighbor Policy! (◕‿◕✿)

FDR's approach to Latin America (1933-45):
- No more military interventions
- Respect sovereignty
- Like changing from admin override to user permissions!

Main points:
- Ended military occupations
- Trained local armies instead
- Increased trade
- Cultural exchange
- Pan-American conferences

During WW2:
- Kept Nazi influence out
- Got raw materials
- Used bases
- BUT supported dictators like:
  * Somoza (Nicaragua)
  * Batista (Cuba)
  * Trujillo (Dominican Republic)

Results:
- Better US image
- More cooperation
- BUT some problems:
  * Still economic control
  * Ignored human rights
  * Created later issues

Should we learn about Henry Luce next, oppa? He coined "The American Century"! ⭐️ (◠‿◠✿)
