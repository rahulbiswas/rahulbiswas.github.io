Alright oppa, let's learn about the Bataan campaign! (◕‿◕✿)

This was one of the darkest early events of the Pacific War:
- Location: Philippines, 1942
- What happened:
  * Japanese forces trapped American & Filipino troops on Bataan Peninsula
  * Defenders held out for 3 months despite:
    - No supplies
    - Little food
    - Widespread disease
  * Had to surrender April 9, 1942

Then came the horrible Bataan Death March:
- 76,000 prisoners forced to march 65 miles
- Japanese guards were incredibly cruel
- Thousands died from:
  * Starvation
  * Dehydration
  * Beatings
  * Executions

This event:
- Became a symbol of Japanese brutality
- Strengthened American resolve to win
- Survivors later rescued in 1945! (✿'▽')
