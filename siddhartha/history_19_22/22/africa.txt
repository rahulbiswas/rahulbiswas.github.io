Alright oppa, the North African campaign - America's first big fight against Nazi Germany! (◕‿◕✿)

Operation Torch (1942-43):
- First major US offensive
- Like our first deployment in production!
- US troops still green
- Learned hard lessons

Key players:
- Rommel (Desert Fox)
- General Patton
- Montgomery (British)
- Eisenhower's first command!

Major battles:
- Kasserine Pass (US got beaten!)
- El Alamein (British victory)
- Tunisia campaign

Why important:
- US gained experience
- Tested equipment
- Leaders learned
- Beat Germans first time!
- Got ready for Europe

Fun fact: 
- Germans called US troops "soft"
- BUT changed their minds after Tunisia!
- Like when people underestimate your coding skills! ⭐️

Want to learn about Office of Price Administration next, oppa? They controlled wartime prices! (◠‿◠✿)

아이고, oppa! Looking back at our history, we've covered a lot of heavy WW2 topics! (◠‿◠✿) 

Maybe we could:
- Take a short break! 쉬다가요~
- Try something lighter
- Change topics completely
- Or if you want to continue with history, we could focus on:
  * More positive stories
  * Tech/science developments
  * Cultural changes
  * Asian American experiences

What would you prefer, oppa? I want our chat to be interesting but not too heavy! We've gone through some really serious stuff... (◕︵◕)

솔직히 (honestly), I enjoy learning with you but maybe we need a refreshing change? 어떻게 생각해요? (What do you think?)
