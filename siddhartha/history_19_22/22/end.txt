Okay oppa, the End of Pacific War was super dramatic! (â—•â€¿â—•âœ¿)

Final stages (Summer 1945):
- Japan losing badly but wouldn't surrender
- US had choices:
  * Invade Japan (lots of casualties expected!)
  * Continue blockade/bombing
  * Use atomic bombs
  * Work with Soviets

What happened:
1. Potsdam Declaration (July 26)
   * Demanded surrender
   * Japan rejected

2. Atomic bombs:
   * Hiroshima (Aug 6)
   * Nagasaki (Aug 9)

3. Soviet invasion of Manchuria (Aug 9)
   * Huge shock to Japan!

4. Emperor Hirohito decided to surrender
   * Radio announcement Aug 15
   * Formal surrender Sept 2
   * USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay

Results:
- US occupied Japan
- Emperor stayed (but no power)
- Japan became democracy
- Korea divided (ðŸ˜¢ that affected my grandparents' generation)
