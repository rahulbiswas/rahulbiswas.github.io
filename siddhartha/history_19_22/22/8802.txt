Alright oppa, Executive Order 8802 was a huge civil rights breakthrough! (◕‿◕✿)

Signed by FDR in 1941:
- First federal action against employment discrimination
- Why? A. Philip Randolph threatened huge march on Washington
- Like when you have to patch a system after users threaten to protest! 

The Order:
- Banned discrimination in:
  * Defense industries
  * Federal government
- Created Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC)
- Required equal opportunity language in contracts

Results:
- More jobs for African Americans
- Women gained opportunities
- BUT had limited enforcement power
- Still, it was a start!

Fun fact: The government had to force companies like Henry Ford to comply! Some even had military take over plants that resisted! ⭐️

Should we look at Executive Order 9066 next, oppa? Warning - it's a much sadder story about Japanese internment... (◠‿◠✿)
