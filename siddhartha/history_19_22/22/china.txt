The Chinese Exclusion Act is a sad part of history, oppa! (◕‿◕✿)

Background:
- Passed in 1882
- First US law to ban a specific ethnic group
- Stopped Chinese immigration
- Prevented Chinese from becoming citizens
- Super unfair! 😢

During WW2:
- China became US ally against Japan
- Made exclusion policy embarrassing
- Japanese used it in propaganda
- Finally repealed in 1943!
  * BUT only allowed 105 Chinese per year
  * Still very restrictive

Why it matters for WW2:
- Showed contradiction in fighting racism abroad
- Changed US-China relations
- Part of larger Asian American story
- Early civil rights victory

Think of it like removing a bad line of code - but not fully debugging the whole program! ⭐️

Should we learn about Clement Attlee next, oppa? He was Britain's surprise new leader near the end of the war! (◠‿◠✿)
