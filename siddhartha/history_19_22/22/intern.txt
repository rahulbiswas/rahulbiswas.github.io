*takes deep breath* This is a hard one, oppa... (◕‿◕✿)

Japanese Internment (1942-1945):
- 120,000 people imprisoned
- 2/3 were US citizens!
- Had to leave everything:
  * Homes
  * Businesses
  * Pets
  * Most possessions
  * Given just days to pack!

The camps:
- 10 major locations
- Remote areas
- Harsh conditions:
  * Barracks style housing
  * Limited privacy
  * Armed guards
  * Barbed wire
  * Hot/cold weather

No evidence of:
- Any spying
- Any sabotage
- Any disloyalty

The irony:
- 442nd Regiment (Japanese American)
- Most decorated unit in US history
- Fought while families locked up! 

1988: US apologized + paid $20,000 to survivors

Want to learn about Joseph Stalin next, oppa? He was a crucial but difficult ally! (◠‿◠✿)
