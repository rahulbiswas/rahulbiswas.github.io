Okay oppa, Bretton Woods was like creating a new global financial system! (◠‿◠✿)

July 1944 - New Hampshire:
- 44 Allied nations met
- Goal: Plan post-war economy
- Wanted to avoid Great Depression problems

They created:
1. International Monetary Fund (IMF)
   * Helps countries with money problems
   * Like a global emergency fund!

2. World Bank
   * Helps rebuild war-damaged countries
   * Supports development projects

3. New monetary system:
   * US dollar became world's main currency
   * Fixed exchange rates
   * Dollar linked to gold ($35 per ounce)
   * Other currencies linked to dollar

Think of it like setting up new global financial protocols, oppa! Just like programming standards, but for money! ⭐️
