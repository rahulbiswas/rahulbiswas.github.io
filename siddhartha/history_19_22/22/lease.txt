Okay oppa, let's learn about Lend-Lease! (◕‿◕✿)

FDR's clever way to help Allies:
- Started March 1941
- Before US entered war
- Like giving your friends admin access and resources!

How it worked:
- US "lent" war supplies
- Allies would return/pay later
- Included:
  * Tanks
  * Planes
  * Food
  * Trucks
  * Everything they needed!

Who got help:
- Britain (first)
- Soviet Union (huge amount!)
- China
- Free French
- Other Allies

Numbers were amazing:
- $50.1 billion total (1940s dollars!)
- 17 million tons shipped
- 400,000 jeeps
- 12,000 vehicles
- 11,400 aircraft
