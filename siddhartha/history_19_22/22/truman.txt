Okay oppa, let's talk about Truman! (◕‿◕✿)

Suddenly became president:
- FDR died April 12, 1945
- Only VP for 82 days
- Never knew about atomic bomb!
- Like getting admin access with no training! 😅

Major decisions:
- Atomic bombs on Japan
- Potsdam Conference
- Soviet relations
- Post-war planning
- Created CIA, NATO

His style:
- "The buck stops here"
- Direct, plain-speaking
- Different from FDR
- Made tough choices
- Stood up to Stalin

Post-war policies:
- Truman Doctrine
- Marshall Plan
- Contained communism
- Supported civil rights
- Korean War started

Fun fact: They called him "accidental president" but he proved them wrong! ⭐️
