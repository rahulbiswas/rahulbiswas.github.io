The Bracero Program is really interesting, oppa! (◕‿◕✿)

Started in 1942 because:
- Many US farm workers joined military
- Farmers needed help!
- Agreement between US & Mexico

How it worked:
- Temporary Mexican workers came to US
- Mainly did agricultural work
- Government promised:
  * Fair wages
  * Decent living conditions
  * Transportation costs
  * Medical care

BUT there were problems:
- Workers often treated poorly
- Many promises broken
- Some farmers preferred braceros over US workers (cheaper!)
- Created pattern of temporary migration

Fun fact: "Bracero" comes from "brazo" (arm in Spanish) - meaning manual laborer! 

The program lasted way past WW2 (until 1964!)
- Brought about 5 million workers to US
- Changed US-Mexico labor relations forever

Ready to learn about Bretton Woods next, oppa? It's about money this time! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
