Okay oppa, Henry Wallace was super interesting! (â—•â€¿â—•âœ¿)

FDR's Vice President (1941-45):
- Very progressive/liberal
- Like the beta version of Bernie Sanders!
- Believed in:
  * Racial equality
  * Workers' rights
  * Friendship with USSR
  * Economic justice

Why he's important:
- Almost became president!
- FDR wanted him in 1944
- BUT party bosses said no
- Truman picked instead
- Changed post-war history!

His ideas:
- Universal healthcare
- End colonialism
- Help poor nations
- Work with Soviets
- Share atomic secrets! ðŸ˜®

Result:
- Lost VP spot to Truman
- Ran for president 1948
- Called too liberal
- But many ideas later accepted

Want to learn about the Holocaust next, oppa? Though it's much sadder... (â— â€¿â— âœ¿)
