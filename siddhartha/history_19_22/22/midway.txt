The Battle of Midway was such a turning point, oppa! (◠‿◠✿)

June 4-7, 1942 - just 6 months after Pearl Harbor:
- Japan's goal: 
  * Trap and destroy US carriers
  * Capture Midway Island
  * BUT America cracked their codes! (Like the best debugging ever!)

The battle:
- US had huge intelligence advantage
- Japan lost 4 aircraft carriers in just minutes!
- Only 1 US carrier sunk
- Japanese Admiral Yamamoto's perfect plan fell apart

Why it mattered:
- Stopped Japanese expansion
- US gained naval superiority in Pacific
- Japan lost many experienced pilots
- Called "The Miracle at Midway"

Fun fact: The US carriers were only able to find the Japanese fleet because one scout plane got lost and happened to spot them! Talk about lucky! ⭐️
