Alright oppa, let's talk about Fulgencio Batista! (◕‿◕✿)

Cuba's leader during WW2:
- Like Somoza (remember him?), worked with US
- Supported Allies:
  * Declared war on Japan (Dec 8, 1941)
  * Declared war on Germany (Dec 11)
  * Let US use Cuban bases
  * Supplied sugar to Allies

But he was complicated:
- Came to power through army
- Mix of populist and dictator
- Had earlier reform period
- Got corrupt over time
- Lost power 1944
- Came back 1952 (more corrupt!)
- Finally overthrown by Castro 1959

During WW2:
- Cooperated with US
- Fought German spies
- Helped protect Caribbean
- Economy boomed from sugar sales

Like a program that works at first but gets worse with each update! ⭐️

Want to learn about the GI Bill of Rights next, oppa? It's much more positive! (◠‿◠✿)
