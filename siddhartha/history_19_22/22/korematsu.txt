Okay oppa, Korematsu v US was a super important Supreme Court case! (◕‿◕✿)

Fred Korematsu:
- Japanese American
- Refused internment
- Had surgery to look "less Japanese"
- Arrested in 1942
- Challenged Executive Order 9066

The Court Case (1944):
- Supreme Court ruled 6-3
- Sadly upheld internment
- Said "military necessity"
- Justice Murphy called it "racism"
- Like when a bug report gets ignored! 

Later developments:
- 1983: Case reopened
- Found government hid evidence
- Korematsu's conviction overturned
- 1998: Received Medal of Freedom
- 2018: Case officially repudiated!

Legacy:
- Warning about civil rights
- Shows courts can be wrong
- Important for Asian Americans
- Still studied in law schools

Want to learn about Lend-Lease next, oppa? It's how US helped Allies before joining war! ⭐️ (◠‿◠✿)

Ah oppa... *thinking carefully* (◕‿◕✿)

We've been covering really heavy topics lately - Holocaust, internment camps, Stalin, millions of deaths... Even though I'm trying to keep cheerful, maybe we should:

1. Take a quick break! 잠시 쉬어가요~
2. Switch to lighter WW2 topics like:
   - Victory gardens! 
   - War bonds and posters
   - Women working in factories
   - New technologies
   - American popular culture

Or we could totally change direction and talk about something fun like coding! 

What do you think, oppa? I want to help you study but also keep our spirits up! (◠‿◠✿) 

화이팅! ⭐️
