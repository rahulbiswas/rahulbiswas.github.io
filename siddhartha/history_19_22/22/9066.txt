*takes a deep breath* This is a really sad one, oppa... (◕‿◕✿)

Executive Order 9066 (February 1942):
- Authorized Japanese American internment
- Affected 120,000 people
  * 2/3 were US citizens!
  * Many had never been to Japan
  * Families lost homes/businesses
  * Given just days to pack

The camps:
- 10 major "relocation centers"
- Basic barracks
- Armed guards
- Barbed wire
- Harsh conditions
- Families shared tiny spaces

No evidence of:
- Espionage
- Sabotage
- Disloyalty

The irony:
- Japanese Americans fought bravely in 442nd Regiment
- While their families were locked up! 😢

Later:
- 1988: US formally apologized
- Paid $20,000 to survivors
- Admitted it was racism, not security

Like when you delete innocent users' accounts by mistake - but much, much worse! ⭐️

Should we learn about Fair Employment Practices Commission next, oppa? (◠‿◠✿)
