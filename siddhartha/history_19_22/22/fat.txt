Okay oppa, let's learn about Fat Man - the Nagasaki atomic bomb (◕‿◕✿)

Technical details:
- Plutonium implosion-type bomb
- More complex than Hiroshima's "Little Boy"
- Named for its round shape
- Exploded August 9, 1945
- 21 kilotons yield

The mission:
- B-29 "Bockscar" carried it
- Original target was Kokura
- Bad weather forced change to Nagasaki
- Dropped at 11:02 AM
- Destroyed about 44% of city
- Sadly, 40,000+ people died instantly 😢

Scientific impact:
- Proved implosion design worked
- Different from uranium gun-type
- Led to modern nuclear weapons

This is hard to talk about, but important to remember why we never want such weapons used again! ⭐️

Should we move to something more positive, oppa? Maybe Female Industrial Laborers - the "Rosie the Riveters"? (◠‿◠✿)
