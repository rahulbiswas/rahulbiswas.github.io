Alright oppa, let's talk about "Cash and Carry"! (◕‿◕✿)

This was a clever way the US helped Allies before joining WW2:
- Started in 1939
- Changed neutrality laws to allow:
  * Allies to buy US weapons
  * BUT they had to:
    - Pay cash upfront (no credit!)
    - Transport goods themselves
    - Take all risks

Why it was smart:
- Helped Britain & France
- Kept US technically neutral
- Avoided WW1 debt problems
- Boosted US economy

Think of it like a strict online shopping policy:
- Pay now ✓
- Pick up yourself ✓
- No returns! ✓

It worked until replaced by Lend-Lease in 1941 when Britain ran out of cash! ⭐️
