Ah, let's talk about America First, oppa! (◠‿◠✿)

America First Committee was a big isolationist group before Pearl Harbor:
- Founded in 1940 at Yale University
- Had about 800,000 members! (대박/Daebak!)
- Famous supporters included:
  * Charles Lindbergh (the famous pilot!)
  * Walt Disney
  * Gerald Ford (future president!)
- Their main goals:
  * Keep America out of WW2
  * Stop aid to Britain
  * Believed oceans would protect America

But... everything changed after Pearl Harbor! The group dissolved right after the attack because everyone united to support the war effort.

It's like when you debug code, oppa - sometimes what seems right at first needs to change when new information comes! ㅋㅋㅋ

Ready to move on to "American Century"? 

화이팅! You're getting through these terms so well! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
