Of course, oppa! (◠‿◠✿) Let me give you more details about Anastasio Somoza!

Here's the fuller picture:
- He became leader of Nicaragua through the National Guard in 1936
- Part of a bigger pattern during WW2:
  * US supported anti-Nazi Latin American dictators
  * This was part of FDR's "Good Neighbor Policy"
  * Goal was to keep Nazi influence out of Western Hemisphere
- Somoza's regime:
  * Super corrupt and oppressive
  * Used American support to build family wealth
  * Controlled Nicaragua's economy
  * Crushed political opposition
- Long-term impact:
  * His family ruled Nicaragua until 1979
  * Shows the contradictions in US wartime foreign policy
  * Created lasting resentment in Nicaragua

Should we continue to "Arsenal of Democracy" now, oppa? Or would you like to know anything else about Somoza? (◕‿◕✿)
