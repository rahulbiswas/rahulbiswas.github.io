    <question>
        <prompt>What happens to the price level and real GDP in the short run when both AD and SRAS decrease?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Price level falls, real GDP falls</option>
            <option letter="b">Price level falls, real GDP rises</option>
            <option letter="c">Price level rises, real GDP falls</option>
            <option letter="d">Price level rises, real GDP rises</option>
        </options>
        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>When both AD and SRAS decrease, both the price level and real GDP fall, as both curves shift left, creating a new equilibrium at lower price and output levels.</explanation>

    <question>
        <prompt>The interest rate effect explains why:</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">The AD curve slopes upward</option>
            <option letter="b">The AD curve slopes downward</option>
            <option letter="c">The SRAS curve slopes upward</option>
            <option letter="d">The LRAS curve is vertical</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The interest rate effect helps explain the negative slope of the AD curve: higher prices increase money demand, raising interest rates and reducing investment spending.</explanation>

    <question>
        <prompt>A decrease in the value of a nation's currency is most likely to:</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Reduce aggregate demand through lower net exports</option>
            <option letter="b">Increase aggregate demand through higher net exports</option>
            <option letter="c">Reduce aggregate supply through higher import costs</option>
            <option letter="d">Both B and C</option>
        </options>
        <answer>d</answer>
        <explanation>Currency depreciation increases net exports (shifting AD right) but also raises import costs (shifting SRAS left), affecting both aggregate demand and supply.</explanation>
    </question>

    <question>
        <prompt>The slope of the aggregate supply curve becomes more vertical as:</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">The economy approaches full employment</option>
            <option letter="b">Unemployment increases</option>
            <option letter="c">Prices become more flexible</option>
            <option letter="d">Wages become more rigid</option>
        </options>
        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>As the economy approaches full employment, additional increases in aggregate demand lead to smaller increases in output and larger increases in prices, making AS more vertical.</explanation>
