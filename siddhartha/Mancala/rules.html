            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>The objective is to capture more stones than your opponent. The game ends when one player has no more stones on their side of the board.</p>

            <h2>Game Setup</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The game board consists of two rows of six small pits, and two large stores (Mancalas) at either end.</li>
                <li>Each of the 12 small pits starts with four stones.</li>
                <li>Your store is the large pit to your right. Your opponent's store is to their left.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your Turn</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pick Up Stones:</strong> Choose one of the six pits on your side of the board and pick up all the stones inside it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sow the Stones:</strong> Moving counter-clockwise, drop one stone into each pit, including your own store. <strong>Do not</strong> drop a stone in your opponent's store.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Special Moves</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Free Turn:</strong> If your last stone lands in your own store, you get to take another turn immediately.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Capture:</strong> If your last stone lands in an <strong>empty pit on your side</strong>, and the pit directly opposite it on your opponent's side has stones, you capture all the stones from the opponent's pit AND your last stone. Place all captured stones in your store.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Ending the Game</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The game ends when all six pits on one side of the board are empty.</li>
                <li>The player who still has stones on their side of the board captures all of those stones and puts them in their store.</li>
                <li>The player with the most stones in their store at the end of the game is the winner!</li>
            </ul>
