            <h1>The Story of Mancala</h1>

            <h2>Ancient Origins</h2>
            <p>
                Mancala is not just one game, but a large family of "sow and capture" games played around the world. It is one of the oldest known games in human history, with evidence suggesting it was played in Ancient Egypt and parts of Africa thousands of years ago. Archaeologists have found rows of pits carved into stone, earth, and wood in areas from the Horn of Africa to the Middle East, dating back centuries.
            </p>

            <h2>A Game of Many Names</h2>
            <p>
                The game's global spread has led to hundreds of regional variations, each with its own unique name and rule set. Some of the most well-known versions include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oware:</strong> A popular version in West Africa, particularly Ghana, known for its complex strategic depth.</li>
                <li><strong>Bao:</strong> A challenging variant played in East Africa, especially Tanzania and Kenya, often involving a larger board and intricate rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Kalah:</strong> The most common version played in the Western world, which is the ruleset our game is based on.</li>
                <li><strong>Congklak:</strong> A popular variant in Southeast Asia, found in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</li>
            '</ul>

            <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
            <p>
                Mancala has always been more than just a pastime. In many cultures, it served as a tool for teaching arithmetic to children, a social activity that brought communities together, and even a ritualistic practice. The act of "sowing" seeds carries deep agricultural and fertility symbolism. It's a game that connects generations, played by both children on the street and elders in quiet reflection.
