        <options>
            <option letter="a">8%</option>
            <option letter="b">4%</option>
            <option letter="c">3%</option>
            <option letter="d">12%</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Using the Fisher equation, nominal interest rate = real interest rate + expected inflation rate. Therefore, expected inflation = nominal rate - real rate = 6% - 2% = 4%. This represents what people expect inflation to be based on the difference between nominal and real interest rates.</explanation>
