        <options>
            <option letter="a">$750</option>
            <option letter="b">$250</option>
            <option letter="c">$1000</option>
            <option letter="d">$0</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>With MPC = 0.75, the Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) = 1 - MPC = 0.25. When income increases by $1000, consumption increases by $750 (MPC × $1000) and saving increases by $250 (MPS × $1000), as each additional dollar must be either consumed or saved.</explanation>
