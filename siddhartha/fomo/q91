        <prompt>If the money supply is $4 trillion and nominal GDP is $20 trillion, what must happen to M if V falls from 5 to 4 and nominal GDP stays constant?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">M must increase to $3.2 trillion</option>
            <option letter="b">M must increase to $5 trillion</option>
            <option letter="c">M must decrease to $3.2 trillion</option>
            <option letter="d">M must decrease to $5 trillion</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Initially, MV = PY means $4T × 5 = $20T. When V falls to 4, to maintain $20T in nominal GDP, M must increase to $5T because $5T × 4 = $20T. This shows how changes in velocity require offsetting changes in money supply to maintain the same nominal GDP.</explanation>
