        <prompt>In a simple deposit expansion, if the required reserve ratio is 25% and a bank receives a new deposit of $10,000, what is the maximum amount this single bank can lend?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">$2,500</option>
            <option letter="b">$7,500</option>
            <option letter="c">$30,000</option>
            <option letter="d">$40,000</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>With a 25% reserve requirement, the bank must keep $2,500 (25% of $10,000) as required reserves. The bank can lend out the remaining 75%, which is $7,500. This is different from the total money creation possible through the entire banking system, which would be determined by the money multiplier.</explanation>
