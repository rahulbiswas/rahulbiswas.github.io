        <prompt>How does the Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) affect the size of the fiscal multiplier?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">A higher MPS creates a larger multiplier</option>
            <option letter="b">A higher MPS creates a smaller multiplier</option>
            <option letter="c">MPS has no effect on the multiplier</option>
            <option letter="d">The relationship depends on the interest rate</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>A higher Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) creates a smaller fiscal multiplier because more of each additional dollar of income is saved rather than spent. Since MPS = 1 - MPC, and the multiplier is 1/(1-MPC), a higher MPS means less recycling of spending through the economy.</explanation>
