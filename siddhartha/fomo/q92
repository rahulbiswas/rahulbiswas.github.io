    <question>
        <prompt>With MPC = 0.8, suppose Congress increases government spending by $50 billion but also raises taxes by $40 billion. What is the net effect on GDP?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">$90 billion increase</option>
            <option letter="b">$50 billion increase</option>
            <option letter="c">$40 billion increase</option>
            <option letter="d">$60 billion increase</option>
        </options>
        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>With MPC = 0.8, spending multiplier = 5 and tax multiplier = -4. Spending effect: $50B × 5 = +$250B. Tax effect: $40B × -4 = -$160B. Net effect = +$250B - $160B = +$90B increase in GDP. The expansionary effect of spending outweighs the contractionary effect of taxes.</explanation>
