        <prompt>How does monetary neutrality relate to the equation of exchange (MV = PY)?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Changes in M have no effect on either P or Y</option>
            <option letter="b">Changes in M affect only Y in the long run</option>
            <option letter="c">Changes in M affect only P proportionally in the long run</option>
            <option letter="d">Changes in M affect both P and Y equally</option>
        </options>
        <answer>c</answer>
        <explanation>Monetary neutrality states that in the long run, changes in the money supply (M) affect only the price level (P) proportionally, with no long-run effect on real GDP (Y). This occurs because V tends to be stable, so when M changes, P adjusts proportionally while Y returns to its natural level.</explanation>
