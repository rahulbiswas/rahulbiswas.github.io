        </options>
        <answer>d</answer>
        <explanation>The 30-year Treasury bond typically offers the highest interest rate because it has the longest maturity. This higher rate compensates investors for tying up their money for a longer period and taking on greater interest rate risk and inflation risk over the extended time horizon.</explanation>
