        <prompt>What happens to the Phillips Curve when there is a positive supply shock?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">The curve shifts outward, resulting in higher inflation and higher unemployment</option>
            <option letter="b">The curve shifts inward, resulting in lower inflation and lower unemployment</option>
            <option letter="c">The curve becomes steeper, showing a stronger trade-off between inflation and unemployment</option>
            <option letter="d">The curve becomes flatter, showing a weaker trade-off between inflation and unemployment</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>A positive supply shock (like improved technology or lower input costs) shifts the Phillips Curve inward. This creates a more favorable trade-off, allowing for both lower inflation and lower unemployment simultaneously - a movement toward the origin of the graph.</explanation>
