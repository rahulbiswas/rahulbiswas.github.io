        </options>
        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>With 10% reserves: First bank keeps $100, lends $900. Second bank keeps $90 (10% of $900), lends $810. Third bank keeps $81, lends $729. Each new deposit is 90% of the previous loan, creating a decreasing sequence that ultimately creates a total money supply increase of $10,000.</explanation>
