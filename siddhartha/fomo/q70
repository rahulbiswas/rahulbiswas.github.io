        <prompt>If the MPC is 0.8 and there is a tax cut of $500 billion, what is the total change in GDP?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">$2000 billion</option>
            <option letter="b">$2500 billion</option>
            <option letter="c">$1600 billion</option>
            <option letter="d">$2400 billion</option>
        </options>
        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>For a tax cut, the multiplier is -MPC/(1-MPC). With MPC = 0.8, the tax multiplier is -0.8/(1-0.8) = -0.8/0.2 = -4. When taxes decrease by $500 billion, the total change in GDP is $500 billion Ã— 4 = $2000 billion (the negative signs cancel out for a tax cut).</explanation>
