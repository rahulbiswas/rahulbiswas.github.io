    <question>
        <prompt>With MPC = 0.8, if government spending increases by $100B and monetary policy raises real GDP by an additional $400B, what is the total change in GDP?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">$500 billion</option>
            <option letter="b">$900 billion</option>
            <option letter="c">$400 billion</option>
            <option letter="d">$800 billion</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>With MPC = 0.8, the fiscal policy multiplier is 5. The $100B spending increase creates $500B in GDP (5 Ã— $100B). The monetary policy directly adds $400B more. Total change = Fiscal effect + Monetary effect = $500B + $400B = $900B, showing how both policies can work together to affect GDP.</explanation>
