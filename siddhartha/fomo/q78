        <options>
            <option letter="a">$400</option>
            <option letter="b">$1600</option>
            <option letter="c">$8000</option>
            <option letter="d">$10000</option>
        </options>
        <answer>d</answer>
        <explanation>With a 20% reserve requirement, the money multiplier is 1/0.20 = 5. The maximum amount of new money that can be created is the initial deposit times the multiplier: $2000 Ã— 5 = $10000. This assumes banks lend out all excess reserves and borrowers deposit all loans back into the banking system.</explanation>
