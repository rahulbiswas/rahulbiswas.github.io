        <prompt>A bank has a 15% required reserve ratio and $300,000 in deposits. If it's currently holding $60,000 in reserves, how much in excess reserves does it have?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">$15,000</option>
            <option letter="b">$45,000</option>
            <option letter="c">$30,000</option>
            <option letter="d">$60,000</option>
        </options>
        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>Required reserves = 15% Ã— $300,000 = $45,000. The bank is holding $60,000 in actual reserves. Excess reserves = Actual reserves - Required reserves = $60,000 - $45,000 = $15,000. This is the amount the bank could lend out while still meeting its reserve requirement.</explanation>
