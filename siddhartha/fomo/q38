        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>Using MV = PY, with constant V, if M increases by 10% and Y by 4%, then P must increase by 6% for the equation to balance. This is because the left side increases by 10%, so with Y increasing by 4%, P must increase by the remaining 6% to maintain the equality.</explanation>
