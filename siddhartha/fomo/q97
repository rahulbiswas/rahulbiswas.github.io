        <prompt>With MPC = 0.75, by how much must taxes change to offset a $200 billion decrease in government spending?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Taxes must decrease by $200 billion</option>
            <option letter="b">Taxes must decrease by $150 billion</option>
            <option letter="c">Taxes must decrease by $250 billion</option>
            <option letter="d">Taxes must decrease by $300 billion</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>With MPC = 0.75, spending multiplier = 4 and tax multiplier = -3. A $200B spending decrease reduces GDP by $800B (4 × -$200B). To offset this, tax change × -3 must equal +$800B. Therefore, taxes must decrease by $800B ÷ 3 = $150B to restore GDP to its original level.</explanation>
