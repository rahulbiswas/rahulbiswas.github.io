        <prompt>The nominal interest rate is 5% and inflation is 2%. If inflation increases to 4% with no change in the real interest rate, what will be the new nominal interest rate?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">5%</option>
            <option letter="b">7%</option>
            <option letter="c">3%</option>
            <option letter="d">9%</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Initially, real rate = nominal rate - inflation = 5% - 2% = 3%. If inflation increases to 4% and the real rate stays at 3%, the new nominal rate must be: real rate + new inflation = 3% + 4% = 7%. This maintains the same real return while accounting for higher inflation.</explanation>
