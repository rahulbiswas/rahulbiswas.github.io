        <prompt>If MPC = 0.8 and MPS = 0.2, what happens to consumption and saving when income increases by $5000?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Consumption +$4000, Saving +$1000</option>
            <option letter="b">Consumption +$1000, Saving +$4000</option>
            <option letter="c">Consumption +$2500, Saving +$2500</option>
            <option letter="d">Consumption +$3000, Saving +$2000</option>
        </options>
        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>With MPC = 0.8, $4000 of the $5000 increase goes to consumption (0.8 × $5000). With MPS = 0.2, $1000 goes to saving (0.2 × $5000). This shows how MPC + MPS = 1, as each additional dollar must be either consumed or saved.</explanation>
