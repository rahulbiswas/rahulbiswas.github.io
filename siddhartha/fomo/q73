    <question>
        <prompt>If velocity (V) is 4, nominal GDP (PY) is $20 trillion, what is the money supply (M)?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">$80 trillion</option>
            <option letter="b">$5 trillion</option>
            <option letter="c">$16 trillion</option>
            <option letter="d">$24 trillion</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Using the equation of exchange MV = PY, we can solve for M: M = PY/V. With PY = $20 trillion and V = 4, M = $20 trillion/4 = $5 trillion. This represents the money supply needed to support this level of nominal GDP at this velocity.</explanation>
