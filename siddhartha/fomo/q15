        <options>
            <option letter="a">0.75</option>
            <option letter="b">1.75</option>

        </options>
        <answer>c</answer>
        <explanation>The Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) equals 1 minus the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC). Since MPC = 0.75, MPS = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25. This means for each additional dollar of income, 75 cents is consumed and 25 cents is saved.</explanation>
