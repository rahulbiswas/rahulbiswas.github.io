    <question>
        <prompt>If velocity (V) falls by 10% and the Fed wants to maintain the same nominal GDP (PY), what must happen to the money supply (M)?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">M must decrease by 10%</option>
            <option letter="b">M must increase by 10%</option>
            <option letter="c">M must increase by 11.11%</option>
            <option letter="d">M must stay constant</option>
        </options>
        <answer>c</answer>
        <explanation>Using MV = PY, if V falls by 10% and we want PY to stay constant, M must increase enough to offset this. When V becomes 0.9 of its original value, M must be multiplied by 1/0.9 (approximately 1.1111) to maintain the same PY, representing an 11.11% increase.</explanation>
