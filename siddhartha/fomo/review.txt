MV = PY
- Called equation of exchange
- M = money supply
- V = velocity
- P = price level
- Y = real GDP
- Quantity theory of money = Theory of monetary neutrality = V,Y tend to be sticky so changes to M affect P roughly proportionately
- In the short term, expanding the money supply can boost AD

Loanable Funds
- Nominal interest rate = Real interest rate + Inflation
- Normal supply demand curve with real interest rate in lieu of price
- Factors affecting supply: People change saving, Foreigners change investment, Incentives, Income changes
- Factors affecting demand: Opportunities, Future sales expectations, Technology, Fiscal policy

Money Market
- Normal demand curve but supply is vertical; Interest rate in lieu of price
- Factors affecting demand: price level, incomeMoPo
- Increase employment
- Stabilize prices
- Grow economy

Tools
- Reserve requirement
- Discount rate
- Open market ops
- Bank reserve rate

Terms
- Recessionary gap = economy below PPF
- Inflationary gap = economy above PPF
- Liquidity trap = Federal funds rate already 0

Rates
- Discount = Bank borrows from fed
- Federal Funds = Bank borrows from bank

Phillips
- AD up (down), Phillips moves towards inflation (unemployment)
- AS up (down), Phillips moves in = low unemployment, low inflation (out = opposite)
- Unemployment not determined by Phillips in long run
FiPo
- Gov spending part of AD
- Gov borrowing crowds out private borrowing
- MPC = marginal propensity to consume
- MPS = 1 - MPC
- Balanced budget multiplier = Tax and spend $x to increase AD by $x
- Automatic stabilizers = TANF, Income tax
- TANF = Temporary Aid to Needy Families

Government Loans
- < 1 year, Treasury bill
- 1 - 5 years, Treasury note
- > 5 year, Treasury bond
