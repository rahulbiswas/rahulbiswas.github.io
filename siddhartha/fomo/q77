    <question>
        <prompt>If MPC = 0.8 and the government increases spending by $100 billion while raising taxes by $150 billion, what is the net change in GDP?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">$100 billion decrease</option>
            <option letter="b">$200 billion decrease</option>
            <option letter="c">$300 billion decrease</option>
            <option letter="d">$400 billion decrease</option>
        </options>
        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>With MPC = 0.8, the spending multiplier is 5 and the tax multiplier is -4. The net effect is: ($100B × 5) + ($150B × -4) = $500B - $600B = -$100B. This shows how combining expansionary spending with larger contractionary taxation leads to a net decrease in GDP.</explanation>
