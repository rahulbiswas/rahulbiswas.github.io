        <answer>c</answer>
        <explanation>With an MPC of 0.8, the spending multiplier is 1/(1-0.8) = 5. When government spending increases by $100 billion, the total change in GDP is $100 billion Ã— 5 = $500 billion, as the initial spending creates multiple rounds of additional spending.</explanation>
