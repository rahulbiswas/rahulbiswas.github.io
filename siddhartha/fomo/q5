        <prompt>Which describes the balanced budget multiplier?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Government spending increases exactly offset by tax increases have no effect on GDP</option>
            <option letter="b">Government spending increases exactly offset by tax increases increase GDP by the amount of the spending</option>
            <option letter="c">Government spending decreases exactly offset by tax decreases have no effect on GDP</option>
            <option letter="d">Government spending increases must be double tax increases to affect GDP</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The balanced budget multiplier shows that when government spending increases are matched by equal tax increases, GDP rises by the amount of the spending change. This occurs because government spending affects aggregate demand directly (multiplier of 1), while taxes work through consumption with only a partial effect (MPC < 1).</explanation>
