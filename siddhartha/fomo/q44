        <explanation>The main difference in interest rates between Treasury bills and bonds is their maturity length. Bonds have longer maturities (over 5 years) than bills (less than 1 year), so they typically pay higher interest rates to compensate investors for the longer time commitment and greater interest rate risk.</explanation>
