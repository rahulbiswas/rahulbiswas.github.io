    <question>
        <prompt>A bank has $200,000 in deposits and an 8% required reserve ratio. If it's currently holding $20,000 in reserves, what is its excess reserve ratio?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">2%</option>
            <option letter="b">4%</option>
            <option letter="c">6%</option>
            <option letter="d">8%</option>
        </options>
        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>Required reserves = 8% Ã— $200,000 = $16,000. Excess reserves = Actual reserves - Required reserves = $20,000 - $16,000 = $4,000. Excess reserve ratio = Excess reserves/Deposits = $4,000/$200,000 = 0.02 = 2%. This represents additional reserves beyond the requirement.</explanation>
