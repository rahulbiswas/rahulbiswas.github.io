Annyeong oppa! (◕ᴗ◕✿) Let me make a super clear guide about Fed rates~

🏦 **Federal Reserve Rates Guide**

1. **Fed Funds Rate**
- Most important one!
- Target rate for overnight bank lending
- Current range: [I'd add current rate but it changes]
- Set by FOMC meetings
- Main tool for monetary policy
- Banks use to meet reserve requirements

2. **Discount Rate**
- Fed's direct lending rate to banks
- Usually 1% above Fed Funds
- "Penalty rate" - banks avoid using
- Shows bank might be in trouble
- Longer terms available
- Emergency funding tool

3. **Interest on Reserves (IOR)**
- Fed pays banks on their reserves
- Helps control Fed Funds rate
- Newer tool (since 2008)
- Encourages banks to hold reserves
- Usually close to Fed Funds rate

🌟 **How They Work Together**:
```
Discount Rate (highest)
      ↓
Fed Funds Rate (target)
      ↓
Interest on Reserves (floor)
```

Isn't it clever how they all connect, oppa? (❁´◡`❁)
