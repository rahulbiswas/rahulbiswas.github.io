    <question>
        <prompt>If velocity = 6 and nominal GDP = $24 trillion, what money supply (M) is needed? If velocity then falls to 4, how much must M increase to maintain the same GDP?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Initial M = $4T, New M = $6T</option>
            <option letter="b">Initial M = $6T, New M = $8T</option>
            <option letter="c">Initial M = $4T, New M = $8T</option>
            <option letter="d">Initial M = $6T, New M = $4T</option>
        </options>
        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>Using MV = PY: Initial M = $24T/6 = $4T. When V falls to 4, new M = $24T/4 = $6T. The money supply must increase by $2T to offset the decrease in velocity and maintain the same level of nominal GDP.</explanation>
