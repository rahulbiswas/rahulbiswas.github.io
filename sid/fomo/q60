            <option letter="b">Supply shocks</option>

        </options>
        <answer>c</answer>
        <explanation>Movements along the short-run Phillips Curve occur when changes in aggregate demand (from monetary or fiscal policy) cause unemployment and inflation to move in opposite directions. Supply shocks and changes in expectations would shift the entire curve rather than cause movement along it.</explanation>
