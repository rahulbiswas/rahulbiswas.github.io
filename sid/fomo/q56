        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>When GDP decreases, fewer transactions occur in the economy, so people need less money to conduct their reduced level of business. This shifts the money demand curve to the left at every interest rate, as less money is demanded for the lower level of economic activity.</explanation>
