        <prompt>A bank has $50,000 in deposits and a 20% reserve requirement. If it currently holds $12,000 in excess reserves, how much more can it lend?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">$2,000</option>
            <option letter="b">$10,000</option>
            <option letter="c">$12,000</option>
            <option letter="d">$8,000</option>
        </options>
        <answer>c</answer>
        <explanation>Required reserves = 20% Ã— $50,000 = $10,000. The bank has $12,000 in excess reserves (above the required $10,000). Therefore, it can lend out all $12,000 of its excess reserves while still maintaining the required reserve ratio.</explanation>
