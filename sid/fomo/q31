        <explanation>When firms expect higher future profits, they want to borrow more money to invest in new projects at any given interest rate. This increases the demand for loanable funds (shifts the demand curve right), resulting in both higher equilibrium interest rates and a larger quantity of funds borrowed.</explanation>
