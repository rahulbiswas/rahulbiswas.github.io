        <options>
            <option letter="a">Higher required reserves increase the money multiplier</option>
            <option letter="b">Higher required reserves decrease the money multiplier</option>

            <option letter="d">Required reserves only affect the money multiplier during recessions</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Higher required reserve ratios decrease the money multiplier because banks must hold more reserves for each dollar deposited, leaving less money available for lending. The money multiplier is calculated as 1/required reserve ratio, so a higher ratio leads to a smaller multiplier.</explanation>
