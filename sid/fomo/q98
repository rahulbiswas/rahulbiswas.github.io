        <prompt>If velocity is 5 and nominal GDP grows from $20T to $22T, by how much must M increase to keep V constant?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">$200 billion</option>
            <option letter="b">$400 billion</option>
            <option letter="c">$600 billion</option>
            <option letter="d">$800 billion</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Initially, M × 5 = $20T, so M = $4T. To maintain V = 5 with new GDP of $22T, new M × 5 = $22T, so new M = $4.4T. Therefore, M must increase by $4.4T - $4T = $0.4T = $400 billion to keep velocity constant while supporting the higher nominal GDP.</explanation>
