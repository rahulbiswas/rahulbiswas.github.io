        <explanation>When businesses become more optimistic about future sales, they want to borrow more to invest in expansion at every interest rate. This increases the demand for loanable funds (shifts the demand curve right), which results in higher equilibrium interest rates and a larger quantity of funds loaned.</explanation>
