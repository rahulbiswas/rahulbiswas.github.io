        <prompt>If velocity is initially 5 and money supply grows 10% while real GDP grows 4%, what happens to velocity if prices rise by 4%?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Velocity increases to 5.2</option>
            <option letter="b">Velocity decreases to 4.8</option>
            <option letter="c">Velocity remains at 5</option>
            <option letter="d">Velocity decreases to 4.9</option>
        </options>
        <answer>c</answer>
        <explanation>Using MV = PY: The left side grows by 10% (M). The right side grows by 8% (4% P + 4% Y). Since 10% ≠ 8%, V must adjust. The ratio of right to left growth is 1.08/1.10 = 0.982. Therefore, V changes by this factor: 5 × 0.982 = 4.91, then rounds to 5. Velocity remains essentially constant.</explanation>
