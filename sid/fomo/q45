            <option letter="d">The money multiplier becomes negative</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>When banks hold excess reserves (more than required), the money multiplier becomes smaller because less money is being loaned out and re-deposited. Since the multiplication process depends on banks lending out their excess reserves, holding excess reserves reduces the money multiplier's effectiveness.</explanation>
