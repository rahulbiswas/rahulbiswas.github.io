    <question>
        <prompt>If MPC = 0.75 and the government simultaneously increases spending by $200 billion and raises taxes by $160 billion, what is the net effect on GDP?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">$200 billion increase</option>
            <option letter="b">$280 billion increase</option>
            <option letter="c">$160 billion increase</option>
            <option letter="d">$120 billion increase</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>With MPC = 0.75, spending multiplier is 4 and tax multiplier is -3. For spending increase: $200B × 4 = +$800B. For tax increase: $160B × -3 = -$480B. The net effect is +$800B - $480B = +$280B. The expansionary effect of spending outweighs the contractionary effect of taxes.</explanation>
