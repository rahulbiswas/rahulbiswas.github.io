    <question number="1">
        <prompt>What determines the demand for labor in a perfectly competitive market?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Marginal product of labor curve</option>
            <option letter="b">Value of marginal product of labor curve</option>
            <option letter="c">Labor supply curve</option>
            <option letter="d">Average product of labor curve</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The demand for labor is determined by the value of marginal product of labor (VMPL) curve, which is the marginal product of labor multiplied by the price of the output.</explanation>
    </question>

    <question number="2">
        <prompt>If the wage rate increases, what happens to a profit-maximizing firm's employment of labor, all else constant?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Increases because workers are more motivated</option>
            <option letter="b">Decreases because labor is more expensive</option>
            <option letter="c">Stays the same because labor is a necessity</option>
            <option letter="d">Cannot be determined without more information</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>As wage rates increase, firms move along their downward-sloping labor demand curve, reducing employment to maintain the profit-maximizing condition where wage equals VMPL.</explanation>
    </question>

    <question number="3">
        <prompt>In a monopsony labor market, what is true about the wage rate compared to a competitive market?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">The wage rate is higher</option>

            <option letter="c">The wage rate is the same</option>
            <option letter="d">The wage rate could be either higher or lower</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>A monopsony employer pays a lower wage rate than would exist in a competitive market because they face an upward-sloping labor supply curve and can influence wages.</explanation>
    </question>

    <question number="4">
        <prompt>Which of the following would lead to an increase in the market demand for labor?</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">A decrease in the price of the final product</option>
