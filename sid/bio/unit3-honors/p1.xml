    <question>
        <text>Which thermodynamic principle explains why living organisms require a constant input of energy to maintain organization?</text>
        <option>First Law of Thermodynamics - Energy cannot be created or destroyed</option>
        <option>Second Law of Thermodynamics - Entropy increases in all natural processes</option>
        <option>Conservation of Mass - Matter cannot be created or destroyed</option>
        <option>Law of Independent Assortment - Traits are inherited independently</option>
        <answer>Second Law of Thermodynamics - Entropy increases in all natural processes</answer>
        <explanation>The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that systems naturally tend toward disorder (increasing entropy). Living organisms must constantly use energy to maintain their highly ordered state against this natural tendency toward disorder.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>A student measures the energy released when glucose is completely oxidized in a calorimeter. Why is this value different from the amount of ATP energy captured by cellular respiration?</text>
        <option>The calorimeter is not accurate enough to measure cellular energy</option>
        <option>Glucose contains more energy than ATP can store</option>
        <option>Some energy is lost as heat during the stepwise oxidation process</option>
        <option>Cells cannot use glucose directly for energy</option>
        <answer>Some energy is lost as heat during the stepwise oxidation process</answer>
        <explanation>During cellular respiration, energy from glucose is released gradually through many small steps. At each step, some energy is lost as heat due to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, making the process less than 100% efficient in capturing energy as ATP.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>Energy conversions in cells involve which of the following changes?</text>
        <option>Only chemical energy to mechanical energy</option>
        <option>Only light energy to chemical energy</option>
        <option>Multiple forms including chemical, light, mechanical, and electrical energy</option>
        <option>Only electrical energy to chemical energy</option>
        <answer>Multiple forms including chemical, light, mechanical, and electrical energy</answer>
        <explanation>Cells perform various energy conversions: photosynthesis converts light to chemical energy, ATP hydrolysis converts chemical to mechanical energy for movement, and membrane transport involves electrical energy. These diverse conversions enable cellular functions.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>Which statement about energy flow in living systems is correct?</text>
        <option>Energy flows in a circular pattern and can be reused indefinitely</option>
        <option>Energy flows linearly through ecosystems and is eventually lost as heat</option>
        <option>Energy is created by plants during photosynthesis</option>
        <option>Energy is destroyed during cellular respiration</option>
        <answer>Energy flows linearly through ecosystems and is eventually lost as heat</answer>
        <explanation>According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, energy cannot be created or destroyed. In ecosystems, energy flows linearly from the sun through producers to consumers, with some energy lost as heat at each transfer, following the Second Law of Thermodynamics.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>An endergonic reaction in a cell:</text>
        <option>Releases energy and occurs spontaneously</option>
        <option>Requires energy input and must be coupled to exergonic reactions</option>
        <option>Only occurs during photosynthesis</option>
        <option>Produces ATP without energy input</option>
        <answer>Requires energy input and must be coupled to exergonic reactions</answer>
        <explanation>Endergonic reactions require energy input to proceed and are not spontaneous. In cells, these reactions are coupled to exergonic reactions (often ATP hydrolysis) that provide the necessary energy. This coupling allows cells to perform essential energy-requiring processes.</explanation>
