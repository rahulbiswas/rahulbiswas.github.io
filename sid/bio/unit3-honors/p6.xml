    <question>
        <text>What is the primary function of photosystem II in the light-dependent reactions?</text>
        <option>Carbon fixation</option>
        <option>Water splitting and oxygen production</option>
        <option>ATP synthesis</option>
        <option>NADPH production</option>
        <answer>Water splitting and oxygen production</answer>
        <explanation>Photosystem II splits water molecules into protons, electrons, and oxygen gas. This process, called photolysis, provides electrons for the electron transport chain and releases oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>How does cyclic electron flow differ from noncyclic electron flow?</text>
        <option>It produces NADPH</option>
        <option>It produces oxygen</option>
        <option>It produces only ATP, not NADPH</option>
        <option>It produces glucose directly</option>
        <answer>It produces only ATP, not NADPH</answer>
        <explanation>In cyclic electron flow, electrons from photosystem I cycle back through the electron transport chain, generating ATP through chemiosmosis but not producing NADPH. This allows cells to adjust the ratio of ATP to NADPH production.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>What role does chlorophyll play in photosynthesis?</text>
        <option>Splitting water molecules</option>
        <option>Absorbing light energy and transferring electrons</option>
        <option>Synthesizing glucose</option>
        <option>Producing oxygen directly</option>
        <answer>Absorbing light energy and transferring electrons</answer>
        <explanation>Chlorophyll molecules absorb light energy, becoming excited and releasing electrons. These electrons enter the electron transport chain, initiating the process of converting light energy into chemical energy.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>Where in the chloroplast do the light-dependent reactions occur?</text>
        <option>Stroma</option>
        <option>Thylakoid membrane</option>
        <option>Outer membrane</option>
        <option>Cell wall</option>
        <answer>Thylakoid membrane</answer>
        <explanation>The light-dependent reactions occur in and across the thylakoid membranes, where the photosystems and electron transport components are embedded. This arrangement allows for efficient energy capture and conversion.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>What products of the light-dependent reactions are used in the Calvin cycle?</text>
        <option>Glucose and oxygen</option>
        <option>ATP and NADPH</option>
        <option>Water and carbon dioxide</option>
        <option>ADP and NADP+</option>
        <answer>ATP and NADPH</answer>
        <explanation>The light-dependent reactions produce ATP and NADPH, which provide the energy and reducing power needed for carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle. These molecules link the light-dependent and light-independent reactions.</explanation>
