        <text>What is the role of cohesins in cell division?</text>
        <option>Break DNA strands</option>
        <option>Hold sister chromatids</option>
        <option>Replicate DNA</option>
        <option>Transcribe genes</option>
        <answer>Hold sister chromatids</answer>
        <explanation>Cohesin proteins hold sister chromatids together after DNA replication until they separate during cell division.</explanation>

        <text>What is the function of Sm proteins?</text>
        <option>Repair DNA</option>
        <option>Form spliceosome core</option>
        <option>Synthesize proteins</option>
        <option>Regulate transcription</option>
        <answer>Form spliceosome core</answer>
        <explanation>Sm proteins form the core structure of spliceosomes, helping to organize snRNAs for pre-mRNA splicing.</explanation>
