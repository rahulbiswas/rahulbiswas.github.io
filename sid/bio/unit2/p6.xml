    <question>
        <text>What is the primary function of clathrin in endocytosis?</text>
        <option>Forms coated pits</option>
        <option>Produces energy</option>
        <option>Breaks down proteins</option>
        <option>Synthesizes lipids</option>
        <answer>Forms coated pits</answer>
        <explanation>Clathrin proteins form a lattice-like coat that helps shape membrane invaginations into coated pits during endocytosis.</explanation>

    <question>
        <text>What characterizes receptor-mediated endocytosis?</text>
        <option>Specific binding</option>
        <option>Random uptake</option>
        <option>Bulk transport</option>
        <option>Passive diffusion</option>
        <answer>Specific binding</answer>
        <explanation>Receptor-mediated endocytosis involves specific binding of molecules to membrane receptors before internalization.</explanation>
