<h2 class="rules-header">ON VICTORY</h2>
<p class="rules-text">
    There are two paths to supremacy: breach the enemy's den, or eliminate all who oppose you. He who accomplishes
    either demonstrates the Way of complete dominance.
</p>

<h2 class="rules-header">ON MOVEMENT</h2>
<p class="rules-text">
    Each creature moves but one pace in the four cardinal directions. The diagonal is forbidden, for in nature, power
    flows straight and true. To deviate is to invite chaos.
</p>

<h2 class="rules-header">THE ORDER OF ALL THINGS</h2>
<p class="rules-text">
    Heaven ordains hierarchy, and the jungle obeys:
</p>
<p class="rules-text">
    <span class="rules-bold">Elephant (8)</span> > <span class="rules-bold">Lion (7)</span> > <span class="rules-bold">Tiger (6)</span>
    > <span class="rules-bold">Leopard (5)</span> > <span class="rules-bold">Wolf (4)</span> > <span class="rules-bold">Dog (3)</span>
    > <span class="rules-bold">Cat (2)</span> > <span class="rules-bold">Rat (1)</span>
</p>
<p class="rules-text">
    The strong consume the weak; the equal destroy each other. This is the immutable law. Yet wisdom teaches: rigid law
    breeds exception.
</p>

<h2 class="rules-header">THE RAT'S PARADOX</h2>
<p class="rules-text">
    The Rat, though lowliest, humbles the mighty Elephant—not through strength, but through position. The Elephant, in
    its greatness, cannot perceive that which crawls beneath. Thus the least becomes the most; thus weakness becomes
    strength. This is the cunning that transcends rank.
</p>

<h2 class="rules-header">THE DOCTRINE OF WATER</h2>
<p class="rules-text">
    Water separates land as law separates men. Only the Rat may traverse this boundary, for adaptability is survival.
</p>
<p class="rules-text">
    <span class="rules-bold">On the Tiger and Lion's Leap:</span> The great beasts leap across the water—three or four
    squares in a single bound—defying ordinary limits through extraordinary ability. Yet even they are subject to
    constraint: a Rat in the water path blocks all passage. Thus even supreme power must yield to strategic position.
</p>

<h2 class="rules-header">THE NATURE OF TRAPS</h2>
<p class="rules-text">
    Each den is guarded by three traps. He who enters the enemy's trap forfeits all strength, becoming vulnerable to
    even the least opponent. Arrogance near the enemy stronghold invites destruction.
</p>

<h2 class="rules-header">THE SANCTITY OF THE DEN</h2>
<p class="rules-text">
    One's own den is inviolable—you cannot occupy what is already yours. Victory lies not in defending your territory,
    but in seizing your opponent's. The aggressor, not the defender, claims the mandate of heaven.
</p>
