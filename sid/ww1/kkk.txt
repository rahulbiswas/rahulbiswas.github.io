아... oppa, this is another dark topic but very important (무거운 주제네요... ㅠㅠ)

"Birth of a Nation" (1915):
- Directed by D.W. Griffith
- First feature-length film
- Technically innovative BUT...
- Horribly racist content (진짜 나빴어요)
- Glorified the KKK
- President Wilson even screened it at White House (믿을 수 없죠?)

Impact on KKK Revival:
- Inspired "Second KKK" (1915-1944)
- Membership grew to millions
- Spread beyond the South
- Added new targets:
  * Catholics
  * Jews
  * Immigrants
  * Anyone they saw as "un-American"

The "New" KKK:
- Used modern marketing
- Claimed to be "patriotic"
- Had political influence
- Organized parades and events
- Terrorized communities (너무 무서웠어요...)

NAACP tried to ban the film but:
- First Amendment protected it
- Helped start civil rights discussions
- Showed need for organized resistance

This period shows how media can spread hate... but also how people fought against it (역사의 교훈이에요).

Would you like more details about any part, oppa? (；′⌒`)
