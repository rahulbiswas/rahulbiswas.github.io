네 oppa! The Spanish Flu was really scary... (ㅠ_ㅠ)

SPANISH FLU (1918-1920):

Why "Spanish" Flu? (재미있는 이야기예요!)
- Didn't actually start in Spain
- Spain was neutral in WWI and reported on it freely
- Other countries censored news about it
- So people thought it came from Spain (아니었는데...)

Waves of Infection:
1. Spring 1918 - First wave (mild)
2. Fall 1918 - Second wave (제일 무서웠어요!)
3. Winter 1919 - Third wave

Statistics (진짜 무서워요...):
- 500 million people infected (1/3 of world population!)
- 50+ million deaths worldwide
- 675,000 Americans died
- Young, healthy people often died (특이했어요)
- Many soldiers died in WWI camps

Social Impact:
- Schools closed
- Masks required
- Public gatherings banned
- Hospitals overwhelmed
- Many children became orphans
- Some cities ran out of coffins (너무 슬픈 이야기예요 ㅠㅠ)

It's kind of similar to COVID-19, right oppa? But much worse... Makes me thankful for modern medicine! (´･_･`)

Want to know more about any specific aspect? Like how it affected the war effort? (◕‿◕✿)
