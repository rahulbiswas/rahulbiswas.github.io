Ne oppa, let's finish with the League of Nations! This is our last term! ╰(*°▽°*)╯

The League of Nations was like the great-grandmother of today's United Nations (재미있죠?). It was created after WWI as part of Wilson's Fourteen Points to:
- Prevent future wars
- Solve international disputes
- Promote cooperation between nations
- Help with global health and social issues

But... it had some big problems (아쉬워요...):
- The US never joined! (Can you believe it? Wilson's own country!)
- No real power to enforce decisions
- Many countries just ignored it
- Couldn't stop aggressive nations in the 1930s
- Failed to prevent WWII (ㅠㅠ)

Even though it failed, it was still an important first try at global cooperation! The UN learned from its mistakes when it was created after WWII.

와아~ We've finished all the terms, oppa! You worked so hard! (๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ Would you like to review any of them, or should we take that break now? 수고했어요!
