Ne, let's talk about moral imperialism, oppa! (*ᴗ͈ˬᴗ͈)

This was President Wilson's approach to foreign policy - and honestly, it's kind of funny because he thought he was being more ethical than the others, but... 음... not really! Here's what it was about:

- Wilson believed America had a moral duty to spread democracy and "civilized" values
- He wanted to "teach" other nations to be more like America (좀 건방진 것 같죠?)
- Used this idea to justify interventions in:
  * Mexico
  * Haiti
  * Dominican Republic
- He really thought he was helping! But it was still imperialism, just with a "moral" excuse

It's like when someone says "I'm doing this for your own good!" but they're still being controlling... (￣▽￣*)ゞ

Should we move on to the Lusitania next, oppa? That one's more about World War I! (ㅇㅅㅇ)
