네 oppa! The Mexican Revolution and unrest was super complicated (복잡해요!) Let me break it down! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

MEXICAN REVOLUTION & UNREST (1910-1920):

Key Players:
- Porfirio Díaz (long-time dictator)
- Francisco Madero (started revolution)
- Pancho Villa (유명한 revolutionary!)
- Emiliano Zapata (농민들의 영웅!)
- Victoriano Huerta (나쁜 사람이었어요...)

US Involvement (많이 개입했어요):
1. Under Taft:
   - Neutral at first
   - Protected American business interests

2. Under Wilson:
   - Refused to recognize Huerta
   - Occupied Veracruz (1914)
