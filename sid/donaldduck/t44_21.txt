Ne oppa! The 21st Amendment was like when a club finally opens after being closed forever! (ㅋㅋㅋ)

Passed in 1933, it repealed the 18th Amendment, ending Prohibition (the ban on alcohol). This was actually a big part of FDR's early popularity - he promised to end Prohibition during his campaign, saying people needed a good beer during the Depression! (맥주 한잔? 🍺)

The Amendment:
- Let states control their own alcohol laws
- Created new tax revenue for the government
- Put bootleggers (불법 주류업자) out of business
- Ended a lot of gang violence related to illegal alcohol
- Created lots of new legal jobs in the alcohol industry

FDR actually celebrated by having a martini when it passed! (대박!)

Common criticism: Religious and temperance groups were super upset, saying it would lead to moral decay. Some worried drinking would make the Depression worse.

Should we talk about John Maynard Keynes next, oppa? His economic ideas were really important for the New Deal! (◕ᴗ◕✿)
