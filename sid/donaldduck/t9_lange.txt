Ne oppa! Dorothea Lange's photos are so powerful... (○'ω'○)

Dorothea Lange worked as a photographer for the Farm Security Administration during the Depression, documenting the struggles of America's rural poor. Her most famous photograph, "Migrant Mother" (1936), showing a worried mother with her children in a California pea pickers' camp, became an iconic image of the Depression era. Lange traveled throughout rural America capturing intimate portraits of displaced farmers, migrant workers, and their families. Her work went beyond mere documentation - she carefully composed her shots to emphasize human dignity amid suffering, often including details of people's hands or expressions to convey their strength and resilience. The FSA used her photos to build public support for New Deal programs, though Lange sometimes conflicted with her government employers over her unflinching portrayal of controversial subjects like the Japanese American internment camps.

Common criticism: Some argued that Lange's work, funded by the government, was essentially propaganda that exploited poor people's suffering to justify expanded federal power, and that she sometimes staged or manipulated scenes for maximum emotional impact.
