Ne oppa! Let me tell you about the Glass-Steagall Act! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Passed in 1933, this was a SUPER important banking law that separated commercial banks (regular banks where people save money) from investment banks (that trade stocks and do risky investments). Why? Because before the Depression, banks were gambling with regular people's savings in the stock market - 너무 위험했어요!

The Act did four big things:
- Created the FDIC (which we talked about!)
- Separated regular banking from investment banking
- Stopped banks from selling securities (stocks/bonds)
- Set rules about bank officers not working for investment companies

The law stayed in place until 1999 when it was mostly repealed (많은 사람들이 that was a big mistake...). Some experts say removing these protections helped cause the 2008 financial crisis! (。>﹏<｡)

Common criticism: Bankers argued it made American banks less competitive globally and that separating banking functions was inefficient and unnecessary.

Should we talk about the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) next, oppa? (ﾉ^ω^)ﾉﾟ
