Ne oppa! The Public Works Administration (PWA) was like Korea's big infrastructure projects but in the 1930s! (◠‿◠)ノ

Run by Harold Ickes (remember him? "Honest Harold"!), the PWA built BIG things from 1933-1939:
- 70% of America's new schools
- 65% of new city halls, courthouses, sewage plants
- Huge dams (Grand Coulee, Bonneville)
- Aircraft carriers (helped win WWII later!)
- Even helped build the Lincoln Tunnel in NYC!

The PWA was different from the WPA because:
- Used private contractors (not direct government employment)
- Focused on big, long-term projects
- Built things to last (많은 건물들 still standing today!)
- Ickes was super careful with money (너무 꼼꼼했어요 ㅋㅋㅋ)

Common criticism: People said Ickes was TOO careful - projects moved too slowly when quick jobs were needed. Some called it "Prince Without Alertness" because it took so long to get things done!
