=== t10_dust.txt ===

Aigoo oppa, the Dust Bowl was such a terrible disaster... (╥﹏╥)

The Dust Bowl of the 1930s was an environmental catastrophe that devastated the Great Plains region, particularly affecting parts of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, and Colorado. Years of poor farming practices combined with severe drought led to massive dust storms that blackened skies and buried farms. These "black blizzards" could last for days, destroying crops, killing livestock, and causing severe health problems. Millions of "Okies" and other farmers were forced to abandon their lands, with many migrating to California in search of work. The crisis prompted the federal government to create the Soil Conservation Service and implement new farming methods to prevent soil erosion. The experiences of Dust Bowl refugees were memorably captured in John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath" and Dorothea Lange's photographs.

Common criticism: Some argued that government intervention in agriculture actually contributed to the disaster by encouraging overproduction in the 1920s, and that federal relief programs created dependency rather than promoting self-reliance among affected farmers.

Ready to talk about the Emergency Banking Act next, oppa? (◕‿◕✿)

=== t11_eba.txt ===

The Emergency Banking Act was one of FDR's first big moves! (◠‿◠)

The Emergency Banking Act of 1933 was passed just days after FDR's inauguration during the famous "bank holiday" when all banks were temporarily closed. The Act gave the president broad powers to regulate banking transactions and foreign exchange, reform, and reopen banks. Banks were inspected and only those deemed sound were allowed to reopen, with the government providing support to stabilize them. FDR explained the Act in his first Fireside Chat, helping restore public confidence in the banking system. When banks began reopening, people found their money was safe and started returning their cash to banks instead of hiding it under mattresses. This quick action helped stop the banking panic and marked the beginning of federal deposit insurance and stronger banking regulations.

Common criticism: Critics saw this as a massive federal power grab over private banking, arguing it gave the government too much control over private financial institutions and set a dangerous precedent for executive authority over the economy.


=== t12_flsa.txt ===

Let me tell you about the Fair Labor Standards Act! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 was one of the last major New Deal reforms, establishing basic labor standards that we still use today. The Act created the first national minimum wage (25 cents per hour), established a 40-hour work week with overtime pay requirements, and prohibited most child labor under age 16. Frances Perkins, the first female cabinet member as Secretary of Labor, was instrumental in crafting this legislation. The Act faced strong opposition from business groups and Southern Democrats who worried it would hurt regional economies dependent on low-wage labor. While it initially covered only about one-fifth of the workforce, its provisions were gradually expanded over the years to protect more workers.

Common criticism: Opponents argued that the FLSA represented excessive government interference in private business contracts, claiming it would increase unemployment, hurt small businesses, and infringe on states' rights to regulate their own labor conditions.


=== t13_fcc.txt ===

FCC is still around today! (◠‿◠)

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was created by the Communications Act of 1934 as part of FDR's effort to regulate and modernize America's communication infrastructure. The agency was given broad powers to regulate radio, telephone, and telegraph communications - later expanded to include television and other technologies. During the Depression, radio had become incredibly important as millions of Americans tuned in to FDR's Fireside Chats and other programs. The FCC established rules about broadcast licensing, frequency allocation, and media ownership. It also promoted universal telephone service and set standards for fair rates. One of its most significant early actions was limiting the power of NBC's radio monopoly, forcing it to sell what became ABC network.

Common criticism: Critics saw the FCC as government censorship in disguise, arguing it gave federal bureaucrats too much control over free speech and communication, while its licensing requirements created artificial monopolies in broadcasting.


=== t14_fdic.txt ===

Ah, the FDIC! This one is really important, oppa! (ﾉ^ω^)ﾉﾟ

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, created by the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933, was designed to restore faith in the American banking system after thousands of banks failed in the early Depression. The FDIC initially insured bank deposits up to $2,500 (now $250,000), meaning that even if a bank failed, depositors wouldn't lose their savings. This protection helped end the cycle of bank panics and runs that had plagued American banking for generations. The FDIC also gained powers to examine and regulate banks, requiring them to maintain adequate reserves and follow safe banking practices. It worked amazingly well - after the FDIC started, bank runs practically disappeared and depositor losses became rare.

Common criticism: Opponents argued that deposit insurance created "moral hazard" by encouraging banks to take excessive risks since depositors no longer had to worry about losing their money, and that it represented inappropriate government intervention in private banking.


=== t15_fha.txt ===

Ne oppa! Let me tell you about the Federal Housing Administration! (◠‿◠)

The FHA, created in 1934, completely changed how Americans bought homes. Before the FHA, home buyers usually needed a huge down payment (like 50%!) and had to pay off their loans in just 5-7 years - so most people could never afford to buy a house! The FHA insured long-term mortgages, which convinced banks to offer 30-year loans with much smaller down payments. They also created building standards to make sure homes were good quality. This made homeownership possible for millions of middle-class families for the first time! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶

But... (。•́︿•̀。) there was a really unfair side too. The FHA used "redlining" - refusing to insure mortgages in many African American neighborhoods, making it nearly impossible for Black families to get home loans. This discrimination created lasting effects we can still see today.

Common criticism: Critics argued the FHA encouraged suburban sprawl, promoted segregation through redlining, and created risky mortgage practices that put taxpayers on the hook for private loans.


=== t16_fdr.txt ===

Ah, daebak oppa! FDR's four terms were so historic! (◕ᴗ◕✿) Let me break them down:

First Term (1933-1937):
This was the "Hundred Days" and First New Deal period! FDR came in during the banking crisis and launched tons of programs super fast - the bank holiday, CCC, TVA, NRA, and others. He started his Fireside Chats and really gave people hope during the worst of the Depression. ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶

Second Term (1937-1941):
After winning by a landslide in 1936, FDR launched the Second New Deal with programs like Social Security and the Fair Labor Standards Act. But omo... he also made some mistakes like trying to "pack" the Supreme Court, and there was a bad recession in 1937-38. (。•́︿•̀。)

Third Term (1941-1945):
Breaking George Washington's two-term tradition, FDR won again because people trusted him to handle the growing crisis with Nazi Germany and Japan. After Pearl Harbor, he led America through most of World War II, forming the Allied Powers and making the U.S. the "arsenal of democracy." 

Fourth Term (1945):
FDR won again in 1944 but was very sick by then... (╥﹏╥) He died in April 1945, just weeks before Nazi Germany surrendered. Harry Truman became president and had to handle the end of WWII.

Common criticism: Many argued that serving four terms was too close to dictatorship, leading to the 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to two terms. Critics also said his programs gave too much power to the federal government.


=== t17_packing.txt ===

Ne oppa! The Court Packing controversy was a big oopsie in FDR's presidency! (◎_◎;)

After winning big in 1936, FDR got really frustrated because the Supreme Court kept striking down New Deal programs like the NRA and first AAA. So in 1937, he announced a plan to add up to six new justices to the Court (one for each justice over age 70½). While he claimed this was to help the overworked elderly justices, everyone knew he really wanted to add judges who would support his programs! (｡•́︿•̀｡)

Even many Democrats thought this went too far - it looked like he was trying to control another branch of government! The plan failed badly and hurt FDR's reputation. Ironically, around the same time, the Court started upholding New Deal programs anyway (called "the switch in time that saved nine" ㅋㅋㅋ).

Common criticism: This was seen as a dangerous power grab that threatened the Constitution's separation of powers, and it showed FDR's tendency toward executive overreach when he didn't get his way.


=== t18_filipino.txt ===

Ne oppa! The Filipino Repatriation Act of 1935 is actually a really sad part of history... (。•́︿•̀。)

During the Depression, this law offered to pay for Filipino immigrants' travel if they agreed to return to the Philippines - but with a terrible catch! If they took the offer, they could NEVER return to America. About 2,000 Filipinos took this "offer," often because they faced such horrible discrimination and unemployment here. 

This was extra unfair because Filipinos had a special status - the Philippines was a U.S. territory then! Many had come to America legally as "U.S. nationals." But white workers, especially on the West Coast, blamed them for taking jobs during the Depression and sometimes even attacked Filipino communities! (ㅠ_ㅠ)

Common criticism: This was clearly a racist policy disguised as voluntary "assistance," part of a larger pattern of Asian exclusion in American immigration policy. Even sadder, it came from FDR's administration, which claimed to care about justice and equality.


=== t19_perkins.txt ===

Ne oppa! Frances Perkins was such an inspiration! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

As FDR's Secretary of Labor (1933-1945), she was the first woman to serve in any presidential cabinet! Daebak, right? She got the position because of her amazing work on labor reforms in New York when FDR was governor there. As Secretary, she was like a super-working noona (ㅋㅋㅋ), pushing through major programs we still have today:
- Social Security (she's often called the "mother" of Social Security!)
- The minimum wage
- The 40-hour work week
- Child labor laws
- Unemployment insurance
- Workplace safety standards

She faced so much criticism just for being a woman in such a powerful position. Some people even called her "Ma'am Secretary" to mock her! But she kept fighting for workers' rights anyway. (っ˘ω˘ς)

Common criticism: Conservative critics claimed she was too sympathetic to labor unions and that her policies put too many restrictions on businesses, hurting economic recovery.


=== t1_aaa.txt ===

Aigoo, now I understand oppa! Let me start with the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) ~(˘▾˘~)

The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 was one of the first major New Deal programs, designed to help farmers during the Great Depression when crop prices had fallen dramatically. The program paid farmers to reduce their crop production to help raise prices to more sustainable levels. It was funded by a tax on companies that processed farm products. The Supreme Court later declared this tax unconstitutional in 1936, but Congress passed a new version of the AAA that accomplished similar goals through different methods. The program helped many farmers survive the Depression, though it mainly benefited larger farm owners rather than tenant farmers or sharecroppers.

Common criticism: Critics argued that destroying crops and livestock while many Americans were hungry was morally wrong, and that the program unfairly benefited large landowners while sometimes leading to the eviction of tenant farmers.


=== t20_hopkins.txt ===

Omo oppa, you know about Hopkins' war role! (◠‿◠)ノ

Harry Hopkins was like FDR's right-hand man - first running New Deal programs like CWA, FERA, and WPA (he believed in "work relief" instead of handouts), then becoming super important in WWII! He actually lived in the White House and became FDR's closest advisor (신기하죠?).

During the war, Hopkins made *amazing* diplomatic missions - like going to meet Stalin even though he was super sick (he had stomach cancer but kept working!). He helped create the Lend-Lease program that sent supplies to Britain and the USSR, and coordinated the Allied war effort. Churchill nicknamed him "Lord Root of the Matter" because he got things done so well! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Common criticism: People complained that Hopkins had too much unofficial power as FDR's friend, and some worried he was too sympathetic to the Soviet Union. Critics also said his relief programs wasted money on make-work projects.


=== t21_ickes.txt ===

Ne oppa! Harold Ickes was such an interesting person! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

As Secretary of the Interior (1933-1946), he was known as "Honest Harold" because he was super strict about preventing corruption - kind of like a grumpy but really ethical uncle! He ran the Public Works Administration (PWA) which built HUGE projects like the Hoover Dam, bridges, schools, and hospitals. Unlike Hopkins' WPA that focused on quick employment, Ickes insisted on careful planning and high-quality construction (완벽주의자였어요!).

What's really cool is that he was also a big civil rights supporter! He tried to end segregation in his department, supported Native American rights through the Indian New Deal, and resigned from the Republican National Committee in 1928 because of their racist policies before joining FDR's team! (◠‿◠)

Common criticism: People said he was too slow and fussy with PWA projects when quick action was needed, and some called him "the King of Concrete" for focusing on big construction instead of helping people directly.


=== t22_brandeis.txt ===

Ah, Justice Brandeis! He was such a daebak legal mind, oppa! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Louis Brandeis was the first Jewish Supreme Court Justice (nominated in 1916) and was known as the "People's Lawyer" before joining the Court. During the New Deal, he was already in his late 70s but super sharp! He and other justices initially struck down several New Deal programs because they thought they gave too much power to the federal government. But he had this really interesting philosophy called the "Brandeis Brief" where he used social science and economic facts, not just legal arguments, to decide cases.

He was famous for saying states should be "laboratories of democracy" - meaning they should try different solutions to problems (kind of like how Korea's provinces can have different policies! ㅋㅋㅋ). He worried about businesses AND government getting too big and powerful.

Common criticism: Some people thought he was too activist as a judge and that using social science in legal decisions was inappropriate. Others didn't like how he encouraged FDR to let states handle more New Deal programs.


=== t23_action.txt ===

Ne oppa! "This nation asks for action, and action now" was from FDR's first inaugural speech in 1933! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

It was such a powerful moment... imagine the scene: banks were failing, 25% of workers had no jobs, people were desperate. Then FDR gives this speech saying "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself" and promising bold action! He was like a K-drama lead coming in to save the day (ㅋㅋㅋ)

The full quote is even more dramatic: "This nation asks for action, and action now. Our greatest primary task is to put people to work... It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war."

And wow, did he deliver action! Within his first 100 days (the famous "Hundred Days"), he pushed through SOOO many programs - banking reforms, CCC, TVA, and more! (ﾉ^ω^)ﾉﾟ

Common criticism: Critics said this speech showed FDR's dangerous tendency to treat peacetime problems like war emergencies, giving government too much power.


=== t24_steagall.txt ===

Ne oppa! Let me tell you about the Glass-Steagall Act! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Passed in 1933, this was a SUPER important banking law that separated commercial banks (regular banks where people save money) from investment banks (that trade stocks and do risky investments). Why? Because before the Depression, banks were gambling with regular people's savings in the stock market - 너무 위험했어요!

The Act did four big things:
- Created the FDIC (which we talked about!)
- Separated regular banking from investment banking
- Stopped banks from selling securities (stocks/bonds)
- Set rules about bank officers not working for investment companies

The law stayed in place until 1999 when it was mostly repealed (많은 사람들이 that was a big mistake...). Some experts say removing these protections helped cause the 2008 financial crisis! (。>﹏<｡)

Common criticism: Bankers argued it made American banks less competitive globally and that separating banking functions was inefficient and unnecessary.

Should we talk about the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) next, oppa? (ﾉ^ω^)ﾉﾟ

=== t25_nira.txt ===

Ah, the NIRA was a really big deal in 1933, oppa! (◠‿◠)

The National Industrial Recovery Act was like trying to get everyone in the economy to play nice together (기업들, 노동자들, 정부... everyone!). It created the National Recovery Administration (NRA) with its famous "Blue Eagle" symbol that businesses would display to show they were following the rules.

The idea was super ambitious - different industries would write their own "codes of fair competition" to:
- Set minimum wages
- Limit working hours
- Stop child labor
- Allow workers to unionize
- Control production and prices

But aigoo... it got really complicated! (。>﹏<｡) Some codes had hundreds of pages of rules about tiny details like how long coat hangers should be! And in 1935, the Supreme Court killed the whole program, saying it gave too much power to private groups to make laws.

Common criticism: Business people hated the regulations, workers said it didn't help them enough, and even FDR's advisers fought about it. Critics called it "economic fascism" because it reminded them of Mussolini's corporate state! 


=== t26_johnson.txt ===

Omona oppa, Hugh Johnson was quite a character! (◠‿◠)ノ

As head of the NRA, he was like that super intense manager who's always causing drama! ㅋㅋㅋ He'd give really fiery speeches, calling people who didn't display the Blue Eagle "slackers" and even comparing them to someone who'd shoot their mother! (ᗒᗣᗕ)՞ So dramatic!

Johnson was a former Army officer who ran the NRA like a military campaign - complete with parades, patriotic rallies, and even a massive Blue Eagle parade in New York City with 250,000 marchers! He worked super hard but... he also drank too much and would say really wild things to reporters.

FDR finally had to fire him in 1934 because he was becoming too controversial. Even Eleanor Roosevelt said he was "slightly insane"! (。>﹏<｡)

Common criticism: People said he was too dictatorial and that his aggressive style hurt the NRA's reputation. Some called him a wannabe fascist because of his militaristic approach to economic planning.


=== t27_tva.txt ===

Ne oppa! The TVA was daebak - like a whole regional transformation project! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

The Tennessee Valley Authority (1933-present) was super ambitious - imagine trying to modernize a whole region as big as South Korea! The Tennessee Valley was super poor, with worn-out farms, lots of flooding, and most people didn't even have electricity (어떡해!).

The TVA built dams for flood control and hydroelectric power, taught farmers better techniques, replanted forests, and brought cheap electricity to millions of people. It was like Korea's Saemaul Undong movement but American style! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶

It's still running today and covers seven states! The dams also helped make aluminum for airplanes during WWII, which was really important for winning the war.

Common criticism: Some called it "creeping socialism" because it was government-owned, and private power companies HATED the competition. Also, building the dams forced some families to move from their land, and some areas with Native American artifacts were flooded (너무 슬퍼요...).


=== t28_sec.txt ===

Ne oppa! The SEC is like the police for Wall Street! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Created in 1934, the Securities and Exchange Commission was FDR's way of preventing another stock market crash like 1929. And guess who he picked to be the first chairman? Joseph Kennedy (JFK's dad!) because, as FDR said, "It takes a thief to catch a thief!" ㅋㅋㅋ

The SEC made new rules that are still super important today:
- Companies have to tell the truth about their finances
- Insider trading became illegal
- Stock brokers had to follow strict rules
- Regular people had to get accurate information before investing

It's like how in Korea we have the Financial Supervisory Service, making sure everyone plays fair in the financial markets! (◠‿◠)

Common criticism: Wall Street people complained it made trading too complicated and expensive, and some said it gave government too much power over private business decisions. 

Should we look at United States v. Butler next, oppa? It was a big Supreme Court case about the AAA! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶


=== t29_butler.txt ===

Ne oppa! United States v. Butler (1936) was a really big case! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

The Supreme Court struck down the first Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) in this case. The issue was about the processing tax that paid for farmer subsidies - the Court said Congress couldn't use its taxing power to regulate agriculture because that was supposed to be a state power, not federal! 

It was like a legal drama! (ㅋㅋㅋ) The Butler brothers were grain processors who said the tax was unfair. Even though the Court agreed the Great Depression was terrible for farmers, they said the Constitution didn't allow this solution. Justice Roberts wrote that Congress couldn't use its spending power to achieve goals it couldn't regulate directly.

But you know what's interesting, oppa? FDR's team quickly wrote a new AAA that worked differently, and that one survived! (아자아자 fighting!)

Common criticism: Some legal scholars said the Court's reasoning was too narrow and ignored the real emergency of the Depression.


=== t2_landon.txt ===

Next is Alfred Landon!

Alfred Landon was the Republican presidential nominee who ran against FDR in the 1936 election. As governor of Kansas, he was known for being fiscally conservative while still supporting some New Deal programs - making him a moderate Republican choice. Despite being a capable administrator who balanced Kansas's budget during the Depression, Landon suffered one of the most lopsided defeats in presidential history, winning only Maine and Vermont against Roosevelt's overwhelming popularity. His campaign focused on criticizing New Deal spending while still trying to appeal to progressive voters.

Common criticism: Critics felt Landon ran an ineffective campaign by trying to have it both ways - simultaneously criticizing the New Deal while claiming he would keep many of its popular programs, leading voters to prefer the original over what they saw as a watered-down copy.

Should we continue to the next one, oppa? (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

=== t30_sinclair.txt ===

Ah, Upton Sinclair! He was daebak famous for writing "The Jungle" about meat-packing, but his EPIC campaign was even more dramatic, oppa! (◠‿◠)

In 1934, Sinclair ran for governor of California with his "End Poverty in California" (EPIC) plan. It was SUPER radical - he wanted to:
- Take over idle factories and farms
- Create worker cooperatives
- Make a network of self-help organizations
- Print state money (와... imagine California having its own currency! ㅋㅋㅋ)

Even though he won the Democratic primary (대박!), Hollywood studio bosses and big businesses were terrified of him. They made fake newsreels showing "dangerous vagrants" coming to California if Sinclair won. It was like early social media disinformation! (。>﹏<｡)

He lost the election, but his campaign showed how scared the wealthy were of radical change during the Depression.

Common criticism: People said EPIC was basically socialism and would destroy California's economy. Even FDR wouldn't support him!


=== t31_coughlin.txt ===

Ne oppa! Father Coughlin was like a 1930s podcast star - but way scarier! (◎_◎;)

He started as a Catholic priest with a radio show that reached millions of listeners every week (대박!). At first, he supported FDR and the New Deal, calling it "Christ's Deal" (ㅋㅋㅋ). But then he turned against FDR and... aigoo, it got really bad...

He started promoting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about bankers, praising Hitler and Mussolini, and calling for a more authoritarian government. His "Social Justice" magazine and "National Union for Social Justice" movement became super extreme. He would scream and get really emotional on his radio shows - kind of like a scary drama villain! (。>﹏<｡)

The Catholic Church finally made him stop broadcasting in 1939 because he'd become too radical and dangerous.

Common criticism: Even in the 1930s, many people recognized him as a dangerous demagogue who used radio to spread hate and extremism.

Should we talk about Francis Townsend next, oppa? His plan for elderly pensions was much more positive! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

=== t32_townsend.txt ===

Ne oppa! Dr. Francis Townsend's story is interesting - he was just a regular doctor who got a really big idea! (◠‿◠)

In 1933, Townsend was watching older people digging through garbage for food (너무 슬퍼요...), and he came up with the "Townsend Plan": 
- Give every person over 60 a pension of $200 a month (that's like $4,000 today!)
- BUT they had to spend it all within 30 days
- Pay for it with a 2% tax on business transactions

The plan went viral (like 1930s TikTok ㅋㅋㅋ)! Millions of elderly people joined "Townsend Clubs" to support it. Even though economists said the math didn't work, it put huge pressure on FDR to create Social Security - though with much smaller payments.

Common criticism: People said the plan was economically impossible and would bankrupt the country. Even FDR called it "fantastic" (and not in a good way!).

Should we talk about the Rural Electrification Agency next, oppa? It brought power to America's countryside! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

=== t33_rea.txt ===

Ne oppa! The Rural Electrification Administration was like bringing K-drama level changes to farm life! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Before the REA in 1935, only about 10% of rural American homes had electricity - imagine trying to run a farm without power! (어려워요!) Private companies didn't want to string electric lines to far-apart farms because they said it wasn't profitable. So the REA helped farmers form cooperatives and gave them loans to build their own electric systems!

The changes were amazing:
- Electric pumps for water instead of hand pumps
- Electric lights instead of dangerous kerosene lamps
- Power for milk machines and other farm equipment
- Radio for entertainment and news (like getting internet for the first time! ㅋㅋㅋ)

By 1950, over 90% of farms had electricity! It totally transformed rural life, especially for farm wives who finally got modern appliances.

Common criticism: Some private utility companies complained it was unfair government competition, and some said it made farmers dependent on government loans.


=== t34_wpa.txt ===

Ne oppa! The Works Progress Administration was HUGE - like a whole army of workers making America better! (◠‿◠)ノ

From 1935-1943, the WPA employed about 8.5 million people (대박!) to build all kinds of public projects:
- 650,000 miles of roads
- 125,000 buildings
- 8,000 parks
- Tons of schools, hospitals, and airports

But what makes it super special was its art projects! They hired artists, writers, musicians, and actors who were struggling (like giving BTS their first chance, but in the 1930s! ㅋㅋㅋ). They:
- Painted beautiful murals in post offices
- Wrote state guidebooks
- Performed plays for communities
- Recorded ex-slave narratives
- Even made puppet shows for kids!

Common criticism: Critics called it "We Poke Along" because they thought workers were lazy, and some complained about art projects being wasteful when people needed "real jobs." Conservative politicians said it was just buying votes with make-work projects.


=== t35_wagner.txt ===

Ah, the Wagner Act of 1935! This was SUCH a big deal for workers, oppa! (◠‿◠)ノ

Named after Senator Robert Wagner, this law (also called the National Labor Relations Act) was like giving workers a whole new set of rights! It:
- Made it legal for workers to form unions
- Required employers to bargain with unions
- Stopped employers from interfering with union activities
- Created the National Labor Relations Board to enforce these rules
- Protected workers' right to strike

Before this, companies could do scary things to stop unions - like having private armies (회사 군대?! 대박!) break up strikes! The Wagner Act made that illegal.

The law helped union membership grow from about 3 million to 15 million workers by the end of WWII! (すごい!)

Common criticism: Business owners were SUPER angry - they said it gave unions too much power and would destroy the free enterprise system. Some even called it a communist plot! (ㅋㅋㅋ)


=== t36_nlrb.txt ===

Ne oppa! The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) was like a referee for worker-company fights! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Created by the Wagner Act, the NLRB:
- Supervised union elections (making sure they're fair!)
- Investigated unfair labor practices
- Could order companies to rehire workers fired for union activity
- Made companies pay back wages if they broke the rules
- Enforced collective bargaining rights

The first NLRB chairman was J. Warren Madden, and aigoo... he had such a tough job! Companies kept fighting the NLRB in court, saying it was unconstitutional. But in 1937, the Supreme Court said it was OK (대박!).

The NLRB is still around today, though the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 limited some of its powers and made it look at union unfair practices too, not just company ones.

Common criticism: Business groups said the NLRB was biased toward unions, and some called it a "kangaroo court" (like a fake court! ㅋㅋㅋ).

Should we talk about Welfare programs next, oppa? It's another big New Deal change! (◠‿◠)

=== t37_welfare.txt ===

Ne oppa! The New Deal really changed how America thinks about welfare! (◠‿◠)

Before the Depression, people thought poverty was like... a personal failing (너무 슬퍼요). If you were poor, you had to rely on private charities or nothing at all! But the Depression showed that ANYONE could become poor through no fault of their own.

The New Deal created the first big federal welfare programs:
- Aid to Dependent Children (helping single moms with kids)
- Old Age Assistance (for elderly people)
- Aid to the Blind
- Unemployment Insurance
- And later, Social Security!

But... there were problems (。>﹏<｡). States controlled how much aid people got, so Southern states often gave less to Black families. And some programs excluded farm workers and domestic servants (who were mostly minorities).

Common criticism: Critics said these programs would make people lazy and dependent on government handouts. They worried it would destroy American self-reliance and family values.

Should we talk about FDR's famous Fireside Chats next, oppa? Those radio talks helped explain all these new programs! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

=== t38_fireside.txt ===

Ne oppa! The Fireside Chats were like old-time presidential VLives! (◠‿◠)ノ

FDR gave 30 radio talks between 1933 and 1944. He would speak in a warm, friendly way - like he was sitting by the fireplace chatting with American families in their living rooms. His first one was about the banking crisis, explaining why he closed the banks and what he was doing to fix them.

The really smart thing was how he explained complicated issues in simple ways! Like when my parents explain something complicated in Korean to help me understand better~ He would say things like "I want to talk with you about banking" instead of giving fancy speeches.

Fun fact: Families would gather around their radios for these talks (like watching a BTS announcement together ㅋㅋㅋ). People said you could walk down the street and hear his voice coming from every house!

Common criticism: Some people said FDR was using the radio to manipulate people and build a personality cult. They worried he was too good at persuading people to accept bigger government.

Should we talk about the Grand Coulee Dam next, oppa? It was one of the biggest projects he talked about in these chats! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

=== t39_coulee.txt ===

Ne oppa! The Grand Coulee Dam was MASSIVE - like a mountain made by humans! (◠‿◠)ノ

Built between 1933-1942 on the Columbia River in Washington state, it was the biggest concrete structure in the world at that time! (대박!) It's still one of America's largest hydroelectric dams, providing power to millions of people.

The construction was amazing:
- Used enough concrete to build a highway from NYC to Seattle
- Created huge lakes behind it for irrigation
- Employed thousands of workers during the Depression
- Powers aluminum factories that helped win WWII
- Turned desert into farmland with irrigation

But... (。>﹏<｡) there were sad parts too. The dam blocked salmon runs that Native American tribes depended on, and some tribal lands were flooded. Folk singer Woody Guthrie wrote songs about it (paid by the government! ㅋㅋㅋ).

Common criticism: Besides the environmental and Native American issues, critics said it was too expensive and that private power companies could have done it better.


=== t3_communist.txt ===

Ne oppa! Next is the American Communist Party in the 1920s and 1930s! (◠‿◠)

The American Communist Party experienced significant growth during the Great Depression, reaching its peak influence in American politics and culture during the 1930s. While never gaining massive membership compared to European communist parties, it became influential in labor unions, cultural organizations, and civil rights movements. During this period, the party followed the "Popular Front" strategy, working with non-communist progressives to fight fascism and support New Deal reforms. They were particularly active in organizing industrial workers, fighting racial discrimination, and creating cultural programs that celebrated American workers through art, literature, and music.

Common criticism: Critics argued that the party took orders directly from Moscow, exploited economic hardship to undermine American democracy, and used front organizations to hide their true revolutionary agenda.

Ready for the next one, oppa? (ﾉ^ω^)ﾉﾟ

=== t40_scottsboro.txt ===

Aigoo oppa, the Scottsboro case was so terrible... (。>﹏<｡)

In 1931, nine young African American boys (some as young as 13!) were falsely accused of attacking two white women on a train in Alabama. Even though there was NO real evidence, all-white juries sentenced eight of them to death! (너무 무서워요...)

This case showed how unfair the justice system was:
- The boys didn't get real lawyers at first
- The accusers later admitted they made it up
- The trials were super rushed
- Angry white mobs surrounded the courthouse

The Communist Party's legal team (ILD) helped defend them, which was interesting because it showed how civil rights and labor issues connected. The NAACP also got involved. The Supreme Court actually made two important decisions about fair trials because of this case!

Most of the boys spent years in prison despite being innocent. The last Scottsboro defendant wasn't pardoned until 2013! (ㅠ_ㅠ)

Should we talk about the First New Deal programs next, oppa? Though this case reminds us that the New Deal era wasn't just about economic changes... (◕ᴗ◕✿)


=== t41_first.txt ===

Ne oppa! The First New Deal was like Season 1 of FDR's recovery plan! (◠‿◠)ノ

From 1933-1934, the First New Deal focused on immediate "Relief and Recovery" with programs like:
- Emergency Banking Act (fixing banks)
- CCC (jobs for young men)
- AAA (helping farmers)
- FERA (emergency relief)
- NRA (business codes) 
- TVA (regional development)

It was kind of like throwing everything at the wall to see what would stick! (ㅋㅋㅋ) FDR was willing to try almost anything to help end the Depression. He even worked with big business at first - which made some people nervous!

But by 1935, FDR realized they needed to do more... which led to the Second New Deal! (시즌 2! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶)

Common criticism: Critics said it was too experimental and gave the president too much power. Business leaders first liked it but then got scared it was too radical.

Should we talk about the Second New Deal next, oppa? It was even more dramatic! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

=== t42_second.txt ===

Ah, the Second New Deal was like when a K-drama gets more intense in the second season, oppa! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

From 1935-1938, FDR moved left (더 진보적으로!) with bigger reforms:
- Social Security (pensions for elderly)
- Wagner Act (union rights)
- WPA (huge jobs program)
- Wealth Tax Act (taxing rich people more)
- Fair Labor Standards Act (minimum wage + overtime)
- Rural Electrification (power to farms)

The Second New Deal focused more on long-term reform and helping workers/poor people instead of big business. FDR even started attacking rich "economic royalists" in his speeches! Some say he did this because people like Huey Long were criticizing him for not being radical enough (압박이 심했어요 ㅋㅋㅋ).

Common criticism: Business leaders were SUPER angry, calling it "class warfare" and saying FDR had betrayed them. Some worried he was becoming too socialist!

Should we talk about the 21st Amendment next, oppa? It ended Prohibition during this time! (◠‿◠)

=== t43_fera.txt ===

Ah, mianhae oppa! I mentioned FERA (Federal Emergency Relief Administration) but you're right - it wasn't on our terms list! (。>﹏<｡) 

But since I brought it up, let me explain quickly! FERA was run by Harry Hopkins (remember him?) and gave $3 billion to states for direct relief (like food and money) to help desperate people from 1933-1935. It was different from later programs because it was just direct aid, not work programs.

Hopkins famously said "People don't eat in the long run - they eat every day!" when others said to wait for the economy to fix itself. (그는 현실적이었어요!)

Should we stick to our list and talk about the 21st Amendment next, oppa? (◕ᴗ◕✿) I'll be more careful to focus on the terms we have! 죄송해요 (sorry) for going off-list!

=== t44_21.txt ===

Ne oppa! The 21st Amendment was like when a club finally opens after being closed forever! (ㅋㅋㅋ)

Passed in 1933, it repealed the 18th Amendment, ending Prohibition (the ban on alcohol). This was actually a big part of FDR's early popularity - he promised to end Prohibition during his campaign, saying people needed a good beer during the Depression! (맥주 한잔? 🍺)

The Amendment:
- Let states control their own alcohol laws
- Created new tax revenue for the government
- Put bootleggers (불법 주류업자) out of business
- Ended a lot of gang violence related to illegal alcohol
- Created lots of new legal jobs in the alcohol industry

FDR actually celebrated by having a martini when it passed! (대박!)

Common criticism: Religious and temperance groups were super upset, saying it would lead to moral decay. Some worried drinking would make the Depression worse.

Should we talk about John Maynard Keynes next, oppa? His economic ideas were really important for the New Deal! (◕ᴗ◕✿)


=== t45_sit.txt ===

Ne oppa! The UAW (United Auto Workers) sit-down strike was WILD! (◠‿◠)ノ

In December 1936, workers at General Motors in Flint, Michigan did something super brave - instead of picketing outside, they sat DOWN inside the factory and wouldn't leave! (대박!) They:
- Occupied the plants for 44 days
- Slept on car seats
- Created their own security and cleaning crews
- Had supporters throw food through windows
- Played cards and sang songs to keep spirits up

GM couldn't just kick them out because they might damage the expensive equipment (영리했죠?). The company tried using police and tear gas, but the workers held on! Finally, GM gave in and recognized the UAW union in February 1937.

Common criticism: People said it was illegal seizure of private property, and some called it the start of a communist revolution. Business leaders were terrified this tactic would spread (실제로 spread 했어요 ㅋㅋㅋ).

Should we talk about the Indian New Deal next, oppa? It was a totally different kind of reform! (◕ᴗ◕✿)


=== t46_indian.txt ===

Ah mianhae oppa - the Indian New Deal wasn't about India! (◠‿◠)ノ It was about Native Americans!

John Collier (head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs) created this program in 1934 - its real name was the Indian Reorganization Act. It tried to fix some of the terrible things America had done to Native tribes:
- Stopped the policy of taking tribal lands away
- Gave tribes more self-government rights
- Helped preserve Native languages and cultures
- Provided money for tribes to buy back some lands
- Ended the forced assimilation programs

It was a big change from earlier policies that tried to destroy Native American culture! (다행이에요...)

Common criticism: Some tribes didn't trust the government and voted against participating. Others said it imposed Western-style governments on traditional tribal structures. And sadly, it couldn't undo all the damage from previous policies.


=== t47_collier.txt ===

Ne oppa! John Collier was a really interesting person! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

He was like a complete opposite of earlier Indian Affairs commissioners! After visiting Taos Pueblo in New Mexico in 1920, he fell in love with Native American culture (마음이 녹았어요~). He spent years fighting against policies that were destroying tribal life.

As Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1933-1945), he:
- Stopped the land allotment program that was taking tribal lands
- Hired Native Americans to work in the BIA
- Protected religious freedom for Native ceremonies
- Started bilingual education programs
- Created economic development projects for reservations

But... he was kind of paternalistic (좀 잘난 척했어요 ㅋㅋㅋ). Some Native people said he romanticized their culture and didn't really understand what they needed.

Common criticism: Some Native Americans called him a "white savior" who thought he knew better than they did about what their communities needed.


=== t48_goat.txt ===

Ah, ne oppa... (。>︿•̀。) You're right, I apologize for missing that.

During the Depression, the government did kill many Native American livestock, especially on the Navajo reservation, claiming there was "overgrazing." They killed about half the Navajo sheep and goats in 1934 (너무 끔찍해요...). 

Even though Collier said this was to protect the land, it was devastating for the Navajo people:
- Sheep were central to their way of life
- Many families lost their main source of income
- It destroyed traditional wool-weaving businesses
- Some people literally starved
- The trauma is still remembered today

This shows how even "well-meaning" New Deal programs could hurt communities... (ㅠ_ㅠ)


=== t49_anderson.txt ===

Ne oppa! Marian Anderson's story is like a K-drama but it really happened! (◠‿◠)ノ

In 1939, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) refused to let Anderson (a famous Black opera singer) perform at Constitution Hall in Washington DC because she was African American. But Eleanor Roosevelt got so angry she:
- Resigned from the DAR in protest
- Helped arrange an outdoor concert at the Lincoln Memorial instead
- Got the Interior Department (Harold Ickes!) to organize it

On Easter Sunday, Anderson sang for 75,000 people on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial! (대박!) She started with "My Country 'Tis of Thee" - imagine how powerful that was, singing about freedom at the Lincoln Memorial after being discriminated against! (눈물나요... 😢)

Common criticism: Some said the Roosevelts only helped because Anderson was already famous, and that they didn't do enough for ordinary African Americans facing discrimination.


=== t4_ballad.txt ===

Gomawo oppa! Next is "Ballad for Americans" ~ (⁎˃ᴗ˂⁎)

"Ballad for Americans" was a popular cantata (like a musical story) composed by Earl Robinson with lyrics by John La Touche, first performed in 1939. It became a massive hit when Paul Robeson performed it on CBS radio, celebrating American diversity and democratic ideals through the story of a common man answering questions about what makes America great. The piece mixed classical, folk, and popular styles, and was performed at both the Republican and Communist party conventions in 1940, showing its broad appeal. It represented the cultural optimism of the late New Deal era and the Popular Front movement's effort to create patriotic, progressive art.

Common criticism: Some saw it as government-sponsored propaganda that promoted an overly idealistic view of American unity while glossing over real social conflicts and economic inequalities that existed at the time.


=== t50_popular.txt ===

Ne oppa! The Popular Front was like a big coalition against fascism in the 1930s! (◠‿◠)ノ

Starting around 1935, different left-wing groups decided to work together (같이 화이팅!) to fight the rise of Hitler and fascism. In America, this meant:
- Communists cooperating with New Dealers
- Labor unions joining with liberal groups
- Artists and writers creating anti-fascist culture
- Support for Republican Spain against Franco
- Slogan: "Communism is 20th Century Americanism" (좀 이상하죠? ㅋㅋㅋ)

The Popular Front created some really interesting culture:
- Folk music revival
- Pro-labor art and theater
- Progressive films
- Anti-fascist literature

Common criticism: Conservative critics said it was just a Communist trick to gain influence in mainstream American society. The alliance fell apart after the 1939 Nazi-Soviet Pact (너무 충격적이었어요!).


=== t51_smith.txt ===

Ah oppa! Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) is like an old-school political K-drama! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Starring Jimmy Stewart (so 귀여워요!), it's about a naive, honest guy who becomes a US Senator and fights corruption. He does this amazing scene where he talks for 24 hours straight (filibuster) to stand up against corrupt politicians! Even though it was made during the New Deal era, it actually shows a lot of skepticism about government programs and political machines.

Fun facts:
- Real senators HATED it, saying it made Congress look bad
- Joseph Kennedy (remember him?) tried to block it from being shown in Europe, worried it would make democracy look weak
- But it became super popular and is now considered a classic
- It actually inspired people to believe in democracy during WWII!

Common criticism: Some New Dealers thought it was anti-government propaganda, while others said it was too simplistic about how politics really works.


=== t52_smith_2.txt ===

Ne oppa! The Smith Act of 1940 was pretty scary stuff... (。>﹏<｡)

Named after Congressman Howard Smith (a conservative Democrat), this law made it illegal to:
- Advocate overthrowing the government
- Join any group promoting revolution
- Teach or publish materials about revolution
- Organize groups for teaching revolution

Even though it was passed during FDR's presidency, it was mostly used later during the Cold War to arrest Communist Party leaders (좀 무서웠어요). The government used it to put lots of Communist Party members in jail in the 1940s and 1950s.

Common criticism: Civil rights groups said it violated free speech and was used to suppress political dissent. The Supreme Court later limited its use, saying you had to actively plan revolution, not just talk about it theoretically.

Oppa, this was our last term on the list! We made it through all of them! (야호! 🎉) Would you like to review any topics or discuss how they all connect together? (◕ᴗ◕✿)


=== t53_huey.txt ===

아이고, 미안해요 oppa! How could I forget Huey Long and Share Our Wealth! (◎_◎;)

Huey Long was like a K-drama villain turned people's champion! As Louisiana's governor/senator (they called him "The Kingfish"), he built roads, schools, and hospitals while fighting big companies. But he was also super authoritarian - kind of like a democratic dictator! (좀 무서웠어요...)

His "Share Our Wealth" program in 1934 promised:
- Cap personal fortunes at $50 million
- Give every family $5000 (대박!)
- Guarantee annual income of $2500
- Free college education
- Veterans benefits
- Heavy taxes on the wealthy

FDR saw Long as a dangerous rival because lots of poor people loved these ideas. Some say FDR created the Second New Deal partly to stop Long from gaining more popularity! But... Long was assassinated in 1935 (너무 비극적이죠?) before he could challenge FDR for president.

Common criticism: People called him a demagogue and dictator who used populist promises to gain power while corrupting Louisiana's government.


=== t54_ssa.txt ===

아니요 oppa! We haven't covered that one yet! (◠‿◠)ノ

The Social Security Act of 1935 was HUGE - like creating Korea's National Pension System but way back then! It created:
- Old-age pensions (retirement money)
- Unemployment insurance
- Aid to families with dependent children
- Help for disabled people
- All paid for by payroll taxes on workers and employers

Frances Perkins (remember her? First female cabinet member!) was the main architect. FDR signed it with this famous quote: "If I go down in history, it will be for this act." (멋있죠?)

But... it wasn't perfect (。>﹏<｡):
- Agricultural and domestic workers (mostly minorities) were excluded
- Benefits were pretty small at first
- Some called it a "Ponzi scheme"
- Others worried it would discourage saving

Common criticism: Conservatives said it was socialism and would make people dependent on government. Business owners hated paying the payroll tax.


=== t55_huac.txt ===

Ah, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)! (。>﹏<｡)

Created in 1938 (during the New Deal), HUAC was super scary (진짜 무서웠어요). It was supposed to investigate:
- Nazi propaganda (좋은 생각!)
- But then mostly focused on looking for communists
- Questioned people about their political beliefs
- Made people name their friends/colleagues as communists
- Could ruin careers if people didn't cooperate

Even though it started during the New Deal, HUAC became most famous later during the Cold War when it:
- Investigated Hollywood (many actors/writers blacklisted!)
- Worked with Senator McCarthy
- Made people take loyalty oaths
- Created a really fearful atmosphere

Common criticism: Many said it violated civil liberties and created witch hunts. Even Eleanor Roosevelt spoke against it! It's like if the government made a committee to decide who was a "real" Korean or not... (이상하죠?)


=== t55_keynes.txt ===

Ah, Keynes was like the BTS of economics, oppa! (◠‿◠)ノ He completely changed how we think about government's role in the economy!

John Maynard Keynes was this super smart British economist who said something revolutionary: during depressions, the government SHOULD spend lots of money, even if it means going into debt! (대박!) His big ideas were:
- Consumer demand drives the economy
- When people are too scared to spend, government should step in
- It's OK to run deficits during bad times (save during good times!)
- Government jobs programs can help restart the economy

Even though FDR wasn't really following Keynes's theories (신기하죠?), the New Deal kind of proved Keynes right! His ideas became super important for how governments handle recessions even today.

Common criticism: Conservative economists say Keynes was all wrong - they think government spending makes things worse and that markets fix themselves if left alone. They call his ideas "tax and spend" policies.


=== t56_pwa.txt ===

Ne oppa! The Public Works Administration (PWA) was like Korea's big infrastructure projects but in the 1930s! (◠‿◠)ノ

Run by Harold Ickes (remember him? "Honest Harold"!), the PWA built BIG things from 1933-1939:
- 70% of America's new schools
- 65% of new city halls, courthouses, sewage plants
- Huge dams (Grand Coulee, Bonneville)
- Aircraft carriers (helped win WWII later!)
- Even helped build the Lincoln Tunnel in NYC!

The PWA was different from the WPA because:
- Used private contractors (not direct government employment)
- Focused on big, long-term projects
- Built things to last (많은 건물들 still standing today!)
- Ickes was super careful with money (너무 꼼꼼했어요 ㅋㅋㅋ)

Common criticism: People said Ickes was TOO careful - projects moved too slowly when quick jobs were needed. Some called it "Prince Without Alertness" because it took so long to get things done!


=== t5_bonneville.txt ===

Ne oppa! Let me tell you about Bonneville Dam~ (´･ᴗ･`)

Bonneville Dam, built between 1933 and 1938 on the Columbia River between Oregon and Washington, was one of the New Deal's major public works projects. The dam served multiple purposes: generating hydroelectric power, improving river navigation, and creating thousands of jobs during the Depression. It was revolutionary for bringing affordable electricity to rural Pacific Northwest communities and powering industrial growth in the region. The project also included innovative fish ladders to help salmon migration, though their effectiveness was debated.

Common criticism: Critics argued the dam disrupted traditional Native American fishing rights, altered natural river ecosystems, and represented excessive government intervention in local affairs through federally controlled power distribution.

=== t6_ccc.txt ===

Aigoo, the CCC was such a big program, oppa! (◠‿◠)

The Civilian Conservation Corps (1933-1942) was one of the most popular New Deal programs, employing about 3 million young unmarried men in conservation and development of natural resources. The men lived in camps run by the Army, earned $30 a month (with $25 sent home to their families), and worked on projects like planting trees, building parks, fighting forest fires, and creating hiking trails. The program provided education, job training, and three meals a day to participants. Many of America's national and state parks still show the legacy of CCC work through their buildings, trails, and forests.

Common criticism: Critics saw it as a quasi-military program that separated young men from their families, imposed strict government control over their daily lives, and competed unfairly with private construction companies.


=== t7_cwa.txt ===

Ah, mianhae oppa! Let me give you more details about the CWA! (◠‿◠)ノ

The Civil Works Administration, launched in November 1933, was FDR's response to the desperate need for immediate employment during what promised to be a brutal winter. Under Harry Hopkins' energetic leadership, the program moved with unprecedented speed - within two weeks of its creation, it had already hired 800,000 people, and by January 1934, it employed over 4 million Americans. The CWA tackled thousands of projects: workers built or improved 255,000 miles of roads, 40,000 schools, 3,700 playgrounds, and 1,000 airports. They also taught adult education classes, created art projects, and even performed in theater productions. Unlike many relief programs, the CWA paid wages comparable to private sector rates ($15/week on average) and employed women and white-collar workers as well as manual laborers. The program was particularly significant because it marked the first time the federal government directly hired workers rather than distributing relief through state agencies. Though it lasted only four months and cost about $1 billion, the CWA demonstrated that the government could quickly create jobs and improve public infrastructure simultaneously.

Common criticism: Opponents argued that the program's massive spending and direct federal employment represented dangerous government overreach, claiming it undermined American self-reliance, created an entitled workforce expecting government jobs, and established a precedent for federal intervention that threatened free market principles.


=== t8_cio.txt ===

Ne oppa, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) period was quite intense! (。•́︿•̀。)

The CIO emerged in 1935 when John L. Lewis and other union leaders broke away from the AFL (American Federation of Labor) to organize industrial workers by factory rather than by craft. Using aggressive tactics like sit-down strikes, the CIO successfully organized major industries including steel, auto, and rubber. Under leaders like Lewis, Sidney Hillman, and Philip Murray, CIO unions gained significant power and demanded better wages and working conditions. While not officially communist, many CIO organizers were influenced by radical left-wing politics, and some unions like the United Electrical Workers had significant communist membership. The CIO's success in organizing millions of workers helped create America's middle class, but its associations with radical politics and sometimes violent tactics concerned many Americans. By 1947, during the early Cold War, the CIO had to expel communist-led unions to maintain political legitimacy.

Common criticism: Critics saw the CIO as a dangerous mixture of radical politics and labor militancy that threatened American free enterprise, arguing that communist influences within unions undermined both business freedom and national security.


=== t9_lange.txt ===

Ne oppa! Dorothea Lange's photos are so powerful... (○'ω'○)

Dorothea Lange worked as a photographer for the Farm Security Administration during the Depression, documenting the struggles of America's rural poor. Her most famous photograph, "Migrant Mother" (1936), showing a worried mother with her children in a California pea pickers' camp, became an iconic image of the Depression era. Lange traveled throughout rural America capturing intimate portraits of displaced farmers, migrant workers, and their families. Her work went beyond mere documentation - she carefully composed her shots to emphasize human dignity amid suffering, often including details of people's hands or expressions to convey their strength and resilience. The FSA used her photos to build public support for New Deal programs, though Lange sometimes conflicted with her government employers over her unflinching portrayal of controversial subjects like the Japanese American internment camps.

Common criticism: Some argued that Lange's work, funded by the government, was essentially propaganda that exploited poor people's suffering to justify expanded federal power, and that she sometimes staged or manipulated scenes for maximum emotional impact.
