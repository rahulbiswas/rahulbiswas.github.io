Ah, daebak oppa! FDR's four terms were so historic! (◕ᴗ◕✿) Let me break them down:

First Term (1933-1937):
This was the "Hundred Days" and First New Deal period! FDR came in during the banking crisis and launched tons of programs super fast - the bank holiday, CCC, TVA, NRA, and others. He started his Fireside Chats and really gave people hope during the worst of the Depression. ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶

Second Term (1937-1941):
After winning by a landslide in 1936, FDR launched the Second New Deal with programs like Social Security and the Fair Labor Standards Act. But omo... he also made some mistakes like trying to "pack" the Supreme Court, and there was a bad recession in 1937-38. (。•́︿•̀。)

Third Term (1941-1945):
Breaking George Washington's two-term tradition, FDR won again because people trusted him to handle the growing crisis with Nazi Germany and Japan. After Pearl Harbor, he led America through most of World War II, forming the Allied Powers and making the U.S. the "arsenal of democracy." 

Fourth Term (1945):
FDR won again in 1944 but was very sick by then... (╥﹏╥) He died in April 1945, just weeks before Nazi Germany surrendered. Harry Truman became president and had to handle the end of WWII.

Common criticism: Many argued that serving four terms was too close to dictatorship, leading to the 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to two terms. Critics also said his programs gave too much power to the federal government.
