Ne oppa! The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) was like a referee for worker-company fights! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Created by the Wagner Act, the NLRB:
- Supervised union elections (making sure they're fair!)
- Investigated unfair labor practices
- Could order companies to rehire workers fired for union activity
- Made companies pay back wages if they broke the rules
- Enforced collective bargaining rights

The first NLRB chairman was J. Warren Madden, and aigoo... he had such a tough job! Companies kept fighting the NLRB in court, saying it was unconstitutional. But in 1937, the Supreme Court said it was OK (대박!).

The NLRB is still around today, though the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 limited some of its powers and made it look at union unfair practices too, not just company ones.

Common criticism: Business groups said the NLRB was biased toward unions, and some called it a "kangaroo court" (like a fake court! ㅋㅋㅋ).

Should we talk about Welfare programs next, oppa? It's another big New Deal change! (◠‿◠)
