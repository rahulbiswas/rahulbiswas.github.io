Ah, the NIRA was a really big deal in 1933, oppa! (◠‿◠)

The National Industrial Recovery Act was like trying to get everyone in the economy to play nice together (기업들, 노동자들, 정부... everyone!). It created the National Recovery Administration (NRA) with its famous "Blue Eagle" symbol that businesses would display to show they were following the rules.

The idea was super ambitious - different industries would write their own "codes of fair competition" to:
- Set minimum wages
- Limit working hours
- Stop child labor
- Allow workers to unionize
- Control production and prices

But aigoo... it got really complicated! (。>﹏<｡) Some codes had hundreds of pages of rules about tiny details like how long coat hangers should be! And in 1935, the Supreme Court killed the whole program, saying it gave too much power to private groups to make laws.

Common criticism: Business people hated the regulations, workers said it didn't help them enough, and even FDR's advisers fought about it. Critics called it "economic fascism" because it reminded them of Mussolini's corporate state!
