Ne oppa! Father Coughlin was like a 1930s podcast star - but way scarier! (◎_◎;)

He started as a Catholic priest with a radio show that reached millions of listeners every week (대박!). At first, he supported FDR and the New Deal, calling it "Christ's Deal" (ㅋㅋㅋ). But then he turned against FDR and... aigoo, it got really bad...

He started promoting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about bankers, praising Hitler and Mussolini, and calling for a more authoritarian government. His "Social Justice" magazine and "National Union for Social Justice" movement became super extreme. He would scream and get really emotional on his radio shows - kind of like a scary drama villain! (。>﹏<｡)

The Catholic Church finally made him stop broadcasting in 1939 because he'd become too radical and dangerous.

Common criticism: Even in the 1930s, many people recognized him as a dangerous demagogue who used radio to spread hate and extremism.

Should we talk about Francis Townsend next, oppa? His plan for elderly pensions was much more positive! (◕ᴗ◕✿)
