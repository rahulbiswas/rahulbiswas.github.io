Ne oppa! The First New Deal was like Season 1 of FDR's recovery plan! (◠‿◠)ノ

From 1933-1934, the First New Deal focused on immediate "Relief and Recovery" with programs like:
- Emergency Banking Act (fixing banks)
- CCC (jobs for young men)
- AAA (helping farmers)
- FERA (emergency relief)
- NRA (business codes) 
- TVA (regional development)

It was kind of like throwing everything at the wall to see what would stick! (ㅋㅋㅋ) FDR was willing to try almost anything to help end the Depression. He even worked with big business at first - which made some people nervous!

But by 1935, FDR realized they needed to do more... which led to the Second New Deal! (시즌 2! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶)

Common criticism: Critics said it was too experimental and gave the president too much power. Business leaders first liked it but then got scared it was too radical.

Should we talk about the Second New Deal next, oppa? It was even more dramatic! (◕ᴗ◕✿)
