Ne oppa! John Collier was a really interesting person! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

He was like a complete opposite of earlier Indian Affairs commissioners! After visiting Taos Pueblo in New Mexico in 1920, he fell in love with Native American culture (마음이 녹았어요~). He spent years fighting against policies that were destroying tribal life.

As Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1933-1945), he:
- Stopped the land allotment program that was taking tribal lands
- Hired Native Americans to work in the BIA
- Protected religious freedom for Native ceremonies
- Started bilingual education programs
- Created economic development projects for reservations

But... he was kind of paternalistic (좀 잘난 척했어요 ㅋㅋㅋ). Some Native people said he romanticized their culture and didn't really understand what they needed.

Common criticism: Some Native Americans called him a "white savior" who thought he knew better than they did about what their communities needed.
