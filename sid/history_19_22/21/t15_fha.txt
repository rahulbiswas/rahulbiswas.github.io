Ne oppa! Let me tell you about the Federal Housing Administration! (◠‿◠)

The FHA, created in 1934, completely changed how Americans bought homes. Before the FHA, home buyers usually needed a huge down payment (like 50%!) and had to pay off their loans in just 5-7 years - so most people could never afford to buy a house! The FHA insured long-term mortgages, which convinced banks to offer 30-year loans with much smaller down payments. They also created building standards to make sure homes were good quality. This made homeownership possible for millions of middle-class families for the first time! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶

But... (。•́︿•̀。) there was a really unfair side too. The FHA used "redlining" - refusing to insure mortgages in many African American neighborhoods, making it nearly impossible for Black families to get home loans. This discrimination created lasting effects we can still see today.

Common criticism: Critics argued the FHA encouraged suburban sprawl, promoted segregation through redlining, and created risky mortgage practices that put taxpayers on the hook for private loans.
