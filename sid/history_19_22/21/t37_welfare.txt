Ne oppa! The New Deal really changed how America thinks about welfare! (◠‿◠)

Before the Depression, people thought poverty was like... a personal failing (너무 슬퍼요). If you were poor, you had to rely on private charities or nothing at all! But the Depression showed that ANYONE could become poor through no fault of their own.

The New Deal created the first big federal welfare programs:
- Aid to Dependent Children (helping single moms with kids)
- Old Age Assistance (for elderly people)
- Aid to the Blind
- Unemployment Insurance
- And later, Social Security!

But... there were problems (。>﹏<｡). States controlled how much aid people got, so Southern states often gave less to Black families. And some programs excluded farm workers and domestic servants (who were mostly minorities).

Common criticism: Critics said these programs would make people lazy and dependent on government handouts. They worried it would destroy American self-reliance and family values.

Should we talk about FDR's famous Fireside Chats next, oppa? Those radio talks helped explain all these new programs! (◕ᴗ◕✿)
