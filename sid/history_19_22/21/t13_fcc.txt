FCC is still around today! (◠‿◠)

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was created by the Communications Act of 1934 as part of FDR's effort to regulate and modernize America's communication infrastructure. The agency was given broad powers to regulate radio, telephone, and telegraph communications - later expanded to include television and other technologies. During the Depression, radio had become incredibly important as millions of Americans tuned in to FDR's Fireside Chats and other programs. The FCC established rules about broadcast licensing, frequency allocation, and media ownership. It also promoted universal telephone service and set standards for fair rates. One of its most significant early actions was limiting the power of NBC's radio monopoly, forcing it to sell what became ABC network.

Common criticism: Critics saw the FCC as government censorship in disguise, arguing it gave federal bureaucrats too much control over free speech and communication, while its licensing requirements created artificial monopolies in broadcasting.
