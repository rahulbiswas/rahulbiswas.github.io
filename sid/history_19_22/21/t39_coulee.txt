Ne oppa! The Grand Coulee Dam was MASSIVE - like a mountain made by humans! (◠‿◠)ノ

Built between 1933-1942 on the Columbia River in Washington state, it was the biggest concrete structure in the world at that time! (대박!) It's still one of America's largest hydroelectric dams, providing power to millions of people.

The construction was amazing:
- Used enough concrete to build a highway from NYC to Seattle
- Created huge lakes behind it for irrigation
- Employed thousands of workers during the Depression
- Powers aluminum factories that helped win WWII
- Turned desert into farmland with irrigation

But... (。>﹏<｡) there were sad parts too. The dam blocked salmon runs that Native American tribes depended on, and some tribal lands were flooded. Folk singer Woody Guthrie wrote songs about it (paid by the government! ㅋㅋㅋ).

Common criticism: Besides the environmental and Native American issues, critics said it was too expensive and that private power companies could have done it better.
