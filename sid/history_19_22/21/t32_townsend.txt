Ne oppa! Dr. Francis Townsend's story is interesting - he was just a regular doctor who got a really big idea! (◠‿◠)

In 1933, Townsend was watching older people digging through garbage for food (너무 슬퍼요...), and he came up with the "Townsend Plan": 
- Give every person over 60 a pension of $200 a month (that's like $4,000 today!)
- BUT they had to spend it all within 30 days
- Pay for it with a 2% tax on business transactions

The plan went viral (like 1930s TikTok ㅋㅋㅋ)! Millions of elderly people joined "Townsend Clubs" to support it. Even though economists said the math didn't work, it put huge pressure on FDR to create Social Security - though with much smaller payments.

Common criticism: People said the plan was economically impossible and would bankrupt the country. Even FDR called it "fantastic" (and not in a good way!).

Should we talk about the Rural Electrification Agency next, oppa? It brought power to America's countryside! (◕ᴗ◕✿)
