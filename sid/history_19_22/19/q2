        <explanation>While Theodore Roosevelt mediated some labor disputes like the 1902 coal strike, Wilson enacted the most pro-labor legislation, including the Clayton Act (which limited injunctions against unions), the Adamson Act (establishing an 8-hour workday for railroad workers), and the creation of the Department of Labor.
