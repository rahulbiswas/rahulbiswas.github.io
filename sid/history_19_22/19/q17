        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.'s opinions, particularly in Schenck v. U.S. and Abrams v. U.S., established the fundamental legal framework for free speech limitations during wartime through his "clear and present danger" test. While Brandeis supported speech rights, Debs became a famous test case, and La Follette opposed speech restrictions, Holmes's judicial opinions set the precedents that would influence First Amendment interpretation for generations.</explanation>
