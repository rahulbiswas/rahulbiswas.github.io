=== apl.txt ===

Ah oppa, the American Protective League! (이건 좀 무서운 이야기예요... ㅠㅠ)

APL (1917-1919):
- Volunteer "citizen spy" organization
- Had about 250,000 members
- Worked with Justice Department
- Like... civilian secret police (무서워요!)

What They Did (진짜 나빴어요...):
- Spied on their neighbors
- Reported "suspicious" activities
- Investigated "un-American" behavior
- Harassed German-Americans
- Hunted for draft dodgers
- Broke up labor unions

Methods Used:
- Opening private mail
- Wiretapping phones
- Following people
- Workplace surveillance
- "Slacker raids" (징병 기피자 찾기)

The Scary Part (제일 충격적인 거...):
- Government approved their actions!
- No oversight or control
- Regular citizens becoming spies
- Created climate of fear
- Violated civil rights

It's kind of like a dark version of "neighborhood watch" - shows how war hysteria can make people do terrible things... (역사에서 배워야할 교훈이에요)

Want to know more about specific APL activities, oppa? (；′⌒`)


=== courts.txt ===

아, 네 oppa! The Supreme Court had some really important cases during this time! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

MAJOR SUPREME COURT CASES:

Lochner v. New York (1905):
- Struck down labor law limiting bakery working hours
- Used "freedom of contract" argument
- Started "Lochner Era" of pro-business decisions (노동자들한테 안좋았어요...)

Muller v. Oregon (1908):

Want more details about any cases or justices, oppa? (●'◡'●)

=== flu.txt ===

네 oppa! The Spanish Flu was really scary... (ㅠ_ㅠ)

SPANISH FLU (1918-1920):

Why "Spanish" Flu? (재미있는 이야기예요!)
- Didn't actually start in Spain
- Spain was neutral in WWI and reported on it freely
- Other countries censored news about it
- So people thought it came from Spain (아니었는데...)

Waves of Infection:
1. Spring 1918 - First wave (mild)
2. Fall 1918 - Second wave (제일 무서웠어요!)
3. Winter 1919 - Third wave

Statistics (진짜 무서워요...):
- 500 million people infected (1/3 of world population!)
- 50+ million deaths worldwide
- 675,000 Americans died
- Young, healthy people often died (특이했어요)
- Many soldiers died in WWI camps

Social Impact:
- Schools closed
- Masks required
- Public gatherings banned
- Hospitals overwhelmed
- Many children became orphans
- Some cities ran out of coffins (너무 슬픈 이야기예요 ㅠㅠ)

It's kind of similar to COVID-19, right oppa? But much worse... Makes me thankful for modern medicine! (´･_･`)

Want to know more about any specific aspect? Like how it affected the war effort? (◕‿◕✿)


=== flu2.txt ===

아, oppa, the Spanish Flu death statistics are really sad... (ㅠ_ㅠ) Let me share the numbers by country:

Highest Death Tolls (대략적인 숫자예요):

British India (지금의 India, Pakistan, Bangladesh):
- 17-18 million (제일 많았어요... 너무 끔찍해요)

China:
- 4-9.5 million

United States:
- 675,000 deaths

Indonesia:
- 1.5 million

Japan:
- 390,000

Britain:
- 250,000

France:
- 400,000

Korea (당시 일본 통치하에...):
- About 140,000-180,000

Some interesting points (알고 계셨어요?):
- Pacific islands were hit really hard
- Some remote communities weren't affected at all
- Poor countries usually suffered more
- Death rates were especially high in young adults (20-40)

It's scary how it spread so fast without modern transportation, right oppa? (((;꒪ꈊ꒪;)))

=== imbeciles.txt ===

아, oppa... that was Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. in Buck v. Bell (1927) - 진짜 끔찍한 판결이었어요... (ㅠ_ㅠ)

The Case:
- About forced sterilization
- Carrie Buck was the victim
- She wasn't actually "mentally deficient"
- Just poor and underprivileged
- But the court allowed her sterilization

Holmes's Quote (너무 충격적이에요...):
"Three generations of imbeciles are enough" 
- Referred to Carrie, her mom, and daughter
- Supported eugenics
- Allowed states to sterilize "unfit" people
- This decision was never officially overturned!

The Impact:
- Led to 60,000+ forced sterilizations
- Influenced Nazi Germany's policies
- Targeted poor and minority women
- Still affects reproductive rights debates

Even though Holmes was considered a great justice in many ways... this shows how even "respected" people supported really horrible ideas back then (정말 슬픈 역사예요...)

Want to know more about eugenics cases or Holmes, oppa? (；′⌒`)


=== india.txt ===

아이고, oppa... India's Spanish Flu story is really tragic (진짜 가슴 아픈 이야기예요 ㅠㅠ)

Several reasons why India was hit so hard:

1. Colonial Conditions (영국 식민지였어요):
- British prioritized war effort over public health
- Took food/resources from India for WWI
- Poor healthcare infrastructure
- Many people already malnourished

2. Environmental Factors:
- Monsoon failure in 1918
- Food shortages
- Drought (가뭄이 심했대요)
- Famine conditions

3. Transportation:
- British troops returning from war
- Railway system spread disease quickly
- Crowded cities
- Many refugees moving around

4. Social Issues:
- Caste system affected treatment
- Poor living conditions
- Limited medical knowledge
- Many people living close together
- No social distancing possible (불가능했어요...)

The British government didn't help much (너무 나빴어요!), and many Indians felt abandoned... Some historians say this actually helped strengthen the independence movement.

Want to know more about how it affected Indian society, oppa? (◕︿◕)

=== indians.txt ===

Ah oppa, that's a really important question... (´･_･`) 

During this time period, Native Americans were facing really tough situations:

1903-1920s:
- Forced assimilation through boarding schools (너무 슬픈 이야기예요...)
  * Children taken from families
  * Forbidden to speak their languages
  * Had to cut their hair and wear Western clothes
  * Many suffered abuse

1906:
- Burke Act made it harder for Native Americans to get citizenship

1907:
- Land allotments continued (많은 땅을 잃었어요)
- Native Americans lost millions of acres to white settlers

1919:
- Native Americans who served in WWI finally got citizenship
- But many others still weren't citizens!

1924 (조금 후에):
- Indian Citizenship Act finally gave citizenship to all Native Americans
- But discrimination continued (ㅠ_ㅠ)

It's sad that our history books often leave this part out, right oppa? Native Americans were going through so much during the same period we just studied... (；′⌒`)

Would you like to know more about any specific aspect? There's a lot more to learn about their experiences...

=== kkk.txt ===

아... oppa, this is another dark topic but very important (무거운 주제네요... ㅠㅠ)

"Birth of a Nation" (1915):
- Directed by D.W. Griffith
- First feature-length film
- Technically innovative BUT...
- Horribly racist content (진짜 나빴어요)
- Glorified the KKK
- President Wilson even screened it at White House (믿을 수 없죠?)

Impact on KKK Revival:
- Inspired "Second KKK" (1915-1944)
- Membership grew to millions
- Spread beyond the South
- Added new targets:
  * Catholics
  * Jews
  * Immigrants
  * Anyone they saw as "un-American"

The "New" KKK:
- Used modern marketing
- Claimed to be "patriotic"
- Had political influence
- Organized parades and events
- Terrorized communities (너무 무서웠어요...)

NAACP tried to ban the film but:
- First Amendment protected it
- Helped start civil rights discussions
- Showed need for organized resistance

This period shows how media can spread hate... but also how people fought against it (역사의 교훈이에요).

=== niagara.txt ===

Ah oppa, you mean the Niagara Movement? (1905-1909) - it was super important for civil rights! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

The Niagara Movement (나이아가라 운동):

Leaders:
- W.E.B. Du Bois (주요 리더였어요!)
- William Monroe Trotter
- 29 other African American leaders

Why "Niagara"? (재미있는 이야기예요~)

Different from Booker T. Washington because:

- Influenced later civil rights movements

=== presidents.txt ===

네, oppa! I'll make a nice study guide for you! ⭐️

Major Accomplishments:

- Veterans Bureau created
- Unfortunately... lots of scandals (스캔들이 많았어요 ㅠㅠ)

Would you like me to add more details to any president's section, oppa? (◠‿◠✿)

=== t1.txt ===

Ne, oppa! That's a great way to study them systematically (^▽^) 

Let's start with "liberal internationalism" ~

Liberal internationalism was a foreign policy philosophy that emerged in the early 20th century. It emphasized:
- Promoting democracy worldwide
- Supporting free trade between nations
- Building international organizations
- Using diplomacy instead of force
- Making the world more peaceful through cooperation

President Woodrow Wilson was a big supporter of this idea! It's kind of like how Korea and other countries work together today through organizations like the UN (유엔) and WTO ヾ(＾∇＾)

Should we move on to the Panama Canal Zone next, oppa? I'll try my best to explain each term clearly! Let me know if you want me to go into more detail about any part of liberal internationalism first though~

=== t10.txt ===

Ah, the 18th Amendment, oppa! This one's kind of crazy... (゜-゜)

Passed in 1919, this amendment banned alcohol in America! Can you imagine? It would be like banning soju in Korea - 말도 안 돼요! ㅋㅋㅋ

Here's what happened:
- Made it illegal to make, sell, or transport alcohol
- Was supported by:
  * Religious groups
  * Women's groups (they thought it would reduce domestic violence)
  * Progressive reformers
  * Anti-immigrant groups (who didn't like beer halls)

But... it didn't work out so well (아이고...):
- People just made illegal alcohol instead
- Organized crime got really powerful
- Lots of people just ignored the law
- The government lost tax money
- It was finally repealed in 1933 by the 21st Amendment

It's like when parents make a rule that's too strict and everyone finds ways around it! (￣▽￣*)ゞ

Should we look at the Espionage Act next, oppa? That one's pretty serious! ╮(─▽─)╭

=== t11.txt ===

Ne oppa, let's talk about the Espionage Act of 1917! (｡•́︿•̀｡)

This one's actually still around today and it's pretty heavy stuff... It was passed shortly after America entered WWI and made it illegal to:
- Interfere with military operations
- Support America's enemies during war
- Promote insubordination in the military
- Interfere with military recruitment

진짜 무서웠어요... The punishment could be:
- Up to 20 years in prison
- Huge fines
- Loss of citizenship rights

Some famous cases:
- Eugene Debs (a socialist leader) went to jail for giving an anti-war speech
- Many newspapers and magazines were banned
- Even saying mean things about the government could get you in trouble! (ㅠㅠ)

Even today, this act is sometimes used - like with Edward Snowden! (대박!)

Ready to learn about the Sedition Act next, oppa? It's kind of like the Espionage Act's strict younger sibling! (●´ω｀●)


=== t12.txt ===

Omo, the Sedition Act of 1918 was even stricter than the Espionage Act, oppa! (°ロ°) !

This law made it illegal to:
- Say anything "disloyal" about the government
- Use "disrespectful" words about the:
  * Constitution
  * Military uniforms
  * Flag
  * Government
- Speak against the war effort

진짜 심했어요... The government arrested:
- Anti-war activists
- Socialist party members
- Labor leaders
- Even people who just criticized the president! (너무해...)

It's kind of like that saying "진실은 전쟁의 첫 희생자" (truth is the first casualty of war), right oppa? The law was repealed in 1920, but wow, it really limited free speech while it lasted!

Should we move on to eugenics next? (◞‸◟；) That topic is pretty dark and uncomfortable...

=== t13.txt ===

*takes a deep breath* 

Ne oppa, eugenics is a really scary part of history... (´;ω;｣) 

It was a horrible pseudoscience that claimed some human genes were "better" than others. In the early 1900s, many Americans (including scientists!) believed in it:

- They thought they could "improve" humanity by:
  * Encouraging "desirable" people to have babies
  * Preventing "undesirable" people from having children
- Led to terrible policies like:
  * Forced sterilization (너무 끔찍해요...)
  * Immigration restrictions
  * Marriage laws
  * Segregation

The worst part? (ㅠ_ㅠ)
- Hitler later used American eugenics ideas in Nazi Germany
- Some states had sterilization laws until the 1970s!
- It affected many vulnerable groups, especially:
  * Poor people
  * Minorities
  * People with disabilities

정말 다시는 이런 일이 없어야 해요...

Should we move on to the NAACP next, oppa? That's a more hopeful topic - they fought against these kinds of prejudices! (ง •̀_•́)ง


=== t14.txt ===

Yes oppa, let's talk about the NAACP! ⭐️ 

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was (and still is!) such an important organization! Founded in 1909, they fought for civil rights and justice (정의를 위해 열심히 싸웠어요!).

Key points about the NAACP:
- Founded by both Black and white activists, including:
  * W.E.B. Du Bois (너무 똑똑한 분이었어요!)
  * Ida B. Wells
  * Mary White Ovington
- Their main goals were to:
  * Stop racial discrimination
  * End lynching
  * Fight segregation laws
  * Get voting rights
  * Improve education

They used peaceful methods like:
- Legal challenges in courts
- Peaceful protests
- Publishing research
- Running education campaigns

The NAACP is still active today! (대단하죠?) They're still fighting for equality and justice! ٩(｡•́‿•̀｡)۶

Should we talk about the Great Migration next, oppa? It's connected to this topic too!

=== t15.txt ===

Okay oppa, the Great Migration was a huge movement that changed America forever! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

From about 1916-1970 (but especially during WWI), millions of African Americans moved from the South to the North and West. 진짜 대단해요!

Why did they move? (이유가 많았어요...):
- Escaping Jim Crow laws and racism in the South
- Looking for better jobs in northern factories
- Seeking better education for their children
- Following family members who moved earlier
- WWI created lots of factory jobs up North

The results were huge:
- Changed the culture of northern cities
- Created new African American communities
- Led to new music and art (like the Harlem Renaissance! 너무 멋있었어요~)
- But also faced new challenges like housing discrimination and job competition

It's kind of like how people in Korea moved from countryside to cities after the war, looking for better opportunities! 

Ready to learn about the sad story of the Tulsa Massacre next, oppa? (；′⌒`) It's pretty heartbreaking...

=== t16.txt ===

*takes another deep breath* 

Oppa, the Tulsa Massacre of 1921 is one of the saddest events in American history... (ㅠ_ㅠ)

It happened in Tulsa's Greenwood District, also known as "Black Wall Street" because it was such a successful African American community (정말 잘 살았어요!). But then...

On May 31-June 1, 1921:
- A white mob attacked the neighborhood
- They destroyed:
  * 35 city blocks
  * More than 1,200 homes
  * Hospitals
  * Churches
  * Businesses
- Hundreds of people died (너무 끔찍해요...)
- Thousands became homeless

The worst part? (눈물나요...):
- No one was ever punished
- Insurance companies didn't pay claims
- It was covered up for many years
- Many people still don't know about it

It wasn't until recently that Tulsa started acknowledging this tragedy properly.

Should we move on to Marcus Garvey next, oppa? He had some interesting ideas about how to respond to this kind of racism... (｡•́︿•̀｡)

=== t17.txt ===

Ne oppa, let's talk about Marcus Garvey! (◠‿◠✿)

He was a really interesting leader who had different ideas from other civil rights activists at the time. Born in Jamaica, he created the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in the 1920s.

His main ideas were (와~ 대단해요):
- Black Pride and Self-Reliance
- "Back to Africa" movement
- Creating black-owned businesses
- Pan-African unity (all black people worldwide working together!)

He even started:
- A shipping company (Black Star Line)
- Newspapers
- Stores and businesses
- The UNIA had millions of members! (진짜 인기 많았어요!)

But... things got complicated (아이고...):
- The government didn't like his ideas
- He was arrested for mail fraud
- Eventually deported back to Jamaica
- But his ideas about black pride and self-reliance influenced later movements!

Should we talk about the Red Scare next, oppa? That was a really scary time in American history! (°ロ°)


=== t18.txt ===

Ah, the Red Scare of 1919-20, oppa! (((;꒪ꈊ꒪;))) 

It was kind of like a massive panic about communism after WWI. The Russian Revolution had just happened, and Americans were super scared it could happen in the US too!

What happened (무서웠어요...):
- Attorney General Palmer led raids on suspected communists
- Many people were arrested without proper cause
- Labor unions were attacked as "revolutionary"
- Immigrants were especially targeted (특히 이민자들이 힘들었어요)
- Some people were deported without fair trials

There were several causes:
- Fear of revolution
- Post-war anxiety
- Labor strikes and unrest
- Bombs sent to government officials
- General fear of foreigners

It's kind of similar to how people sometimes blame others when they're scared, right oppa? (ㅠㅠ)

Should we move on to the Versailles Treaty next? That was the big peace treaty after WWI! (ᵔᴥᵔ)

=== t19.txt ===

Okay oppa, the Treaty of Versailles! 진짜 중요한 조약이에요! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

Signed in 1919 after WWI ended, this treaty was supposed to bring peace but... 음... it kind of created more problems instead! Here's what it did:

The main points (많이 있어요!):
- Made Germany take blame for the war
- Germany had to pay HUGE reparations
- Germany lost lots of territory
- Germany's military was limited
- Created new nations in Europe
- Established the League of Nations

But there were big problems (아이고...):
- Germany felt humiliated and angry
- The US Senate refused to ratify it
- Many of Wilson's Fourteen Points were ignored
- The punishment was too harsh (너무 심했어요!)

Historians say this treaty actually helped lead to WWII because it made Germans so resentful... (ㅠ_ㅠ)

Should we finish with the League of Nations, oppa? It's our last term! (ファイト! ٩(ᐛ)و )


=== t2.txt ===

Aigoo~ The Panama Canal Zone is such an interesting topic, oppa! (｀・ω・´)

The Panama Canal Zone was a strip of land (about 10 miles wide) that the US controlled from 1903 to 1979. Here's the story:
- The US really wanted to build a canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
- They first tried working with Colombia (Panama was part of Colombia then)
- When Colombia said no, the US supported Panama's independence movement
- As a "thank you," the new Panama government gave the US control of the canal zone
- The US paid $10 million plus yearly rent

It was super important for:
- Military ships moving between oceans faster
- International trade (like how the Suez Canal helps ships today!)
- Showing America's growing power in the world

대박! It's kind of amazing how one canal could be so important, right oppa? Should we look at the Roosevelt Corollary next? (｡♥‿♥｡)

=== t20.txt ===

Ne oppa, let's finish with the League of Nations! This is our last term! ╰(*°▽°*)╯

The League of Nations was like the great-grandmother of today's United Nations (재미있죠?). It was created after WWI as part of Wilson's Fourteen Points to:
- Prevent future wars
- Solve international disputes
- Promote cooperation between nations
- Help with global health and social issues

But... it had some big problems (아쉬워요...):
- The US never joined! (Can you believe it? Wilson's own country!)
- No real power to enforce decisions
- Many countries just ignored it
- Couldn't stop aggressive nations in the 1930s
- Failed to prevent WWII (ㅠㅠ)

Even though it failed, it was still an important first try at global cooperation! The UN learned from its mistakes when it was created after WWII.

와아~ We've finished all the terms, oppa! You worked so hard! (๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ Would you like to review any of them, or should we take that break now? 수고했어요!

=== t3.txt ===

Okay oppa, let me tell you about the Roosevelt Corollary! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶

This was President Theodore Roosevelt's addition to the Monroe Doctrine in 1904. It's really interesting because it showed how America was becoming more powerful! Here's what it meant:

- The US claimed the right to intervene in Latin American countries if they had problems with European powers
- Basically said "Hey Europe, stay out! We'll handle any issues in the Americas"
- Roosevelt called it "carrying a big stick" (좀 무서워요...)
- The US used this to justify military interventions in places like:
  * Dominican Republic
  * Cuba
  * Nicaragua

It's like when an older sibling says "Only I can mess with my younger siblings!" (ㅋㅋㅋ)

Should we move on to "dollar diplomacy" next, oppa? That one's related to this too! (＾▽＾)

=== t4.txt ===

Aigoo~ Dollar Diplomacy is next, oppa! (◕‿◕✿)

This was President Taft's foreign policy approach after Roosevelt. Instead of Roosevelt's "big stick," Taft preferred to use American money and businesses! Here's how it worked:

- US banks would loan money to other countries (especially in Latin America and Asia)
- American businesses would invest there too
- The idea was to increase US influence through economic power instead of military power
- Kind of like "make money, not war!" ㅋㅋㅋ

But... it didn't always work out so well (´･_･`):
- Some countries felt the US was trying to control them
- It sometimes led to military intervention anyway when investments were threatened
- It's a bit like when someone says they're helping but really want something in return... 좀 그렇죠?

Ready to move on to "moral imperialism" next, Rahul-oppa? That one's pretty interesting too! ⭐️

=== t5.txt ===

Ne, let's talk about moral imperialism, oppa! (*ᴗ͈ˬᴗ͈)

This was President Wilson's approach to foreign policy - and honestly, it's kind of funny because he thought he was being more ethical than the others, but... 음... not really! Here's what it was about:

- Wilson believed America had a moral duty to spread democracy and "civilized" values
- He wanted to "teach" other nations to be more like America (좀 건방진 것 같죠?)
- Used this idea to justify interventions in:
  * Mexico
  * Haiti
  * Dominican Republic
- He really thought he was helping! But it was still imperialism, just with a "moral" excuse

It's like when someone says "I'm doing this for your own good!" but they're still being controlling... (￣▽￣*)ゞ

Should we move on to the Lusitania next, oppa? That one's more about World War I! (ㅇㅅㅇ)

=== t6.txt ===

Ah, the Lusitania... this one's actually pretty sad, oppa (╥﹏╥)

The Lusitania was a British passenger ship that was sunk by a German U-boat in 1915. Here's what happened:

- It was a luxury liner carrying 1,959 passengers and crew
- Germany had warned people not to travel on British ships
- But people thought, "아이구, it's just a passenger ship, they wouldn't attack it!"
- On May 7, 1915, a German submarine torpedoed it
- 1,198 people died, including 128 Americans (너무 슬프죠...)

This event was SUPER important because:
- It made Americans really angry at Germany
- Helped turn US public opinion towards joining WWI
- Germany promised to stop attacking passenger ships (but later broke that promise 나쁘다!)

Ready to learn about Wilson's Fourteen Points next, oppa? That was kind of like America's wishlist for after the war! (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧

=== t7.txt ===

Okay oppa, the Fourteen Points is coming up! ٩(◕‿◕)۶

President Wilson announced these in January 1918 as his plan for peace after WWI. Think of it like a big wishlist for world peace! Here are some of the major points:

- Freedom of the seas (바다는 모두의 것!)
- No more secret treaties between countries
- Reducing military weapons
- Self-determination (letting people choose their own government)
- Creating the League of Nations (like the UN's grandmother! ㅋㅋㅋ)

But... sadly not all of these points were accepted (´•̥ω•̥`):
- The other Allied powers thought Wilson was too idealistic
- They wanted to punish Germany more harshly
- Most of the points didn't make it into the final peace treaty

It's kind of like when you have a great idea but your friends want to do something else instead... 아쉽죠?

Should we look at the Selective Service Act next, oppa? That's about how America got soldiers for the war! (•ᴗ•)

=== t8.txt ===

Ne oppa, let's talk about the Selective Service Act! (ง •̀ω•́)ง

This was America's way of getting soldiers for WWI in 1917. It's kind of similar to Korea's military service system today! Here's what it did:

- Required ALL men aged 21-30 to register for the draft (later expanded to 18-45)
- It was the first time America used a draft since the Civil War
- Almost 24 million men registered (대박!)
- About 2.8 million were actually drafted
- Another 2 million volunteered

Some interesting points:
- You could be exempted if you were:
  * Supporting your family
  * Working in important industries
  * A religious conscientious objector
- But some people tried to dodge the draft (나쁜 사람들...)

The system was pretty fair for its time - rich and poor had to serve alike! Unlike earlier drafts where rich people could pay someone else to go instead (너무 이상하죠??)

Ready to learn about the War Industries Board next, oppa? (｡♥‿♥｡)

=== t9.txt ===

Alright oppa, let me tell you about the War Industries Board! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

This was like America's big control center for the economy during WWI. Think of it as the government being like a strict parent making sure everyone worked together properly! 

Here's what the WIB did:
- Controlled what factories made (무기, 군복, etc.)
- Set production quotas and prices
- Distributed raw materials
- Convinced companies to be more efficient
- Coordinated with the Allies about what they needed

The head of the WIB was Bernard Baruch (똑똑한 사람이었어요!), and he:
- Got businesses to cooperate voluntarily
- Helped convert peacetime factories to war production
- Made sure resources weren't wasted

It was America's first try at a planned economy - kind of fascinating how they managed it all, right oppa? Even though it only lasted during the war!

Should we move on to the 18th Amendment? 아, that one's about prohibition! (◠‿◠✿)
