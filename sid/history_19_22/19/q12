        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>Du Bois's strategy of demanding immediate equal rights and using protest, legal action, and published research became the dominant civil rights approach for decades. His founding role in the NAACP and emphasis on higher education and political rights shaped the modern civil rights movement. While Washington's economic approach was initially more popular, Wells's journalism tactics more limited, and Garvey's movement relatively short-lived, Du Bois's methods became the blueprint for future activism.</explanation>
