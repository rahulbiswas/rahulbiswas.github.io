        </options>
        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>The 17th Amendment's requirement for direct election of senators fundamentally changed American democracy by giving voters, rather than state legislatures, control over Senate selections. While initiative and referendum expanded direct democracy in some states, utility ownership remained limited, and Prohibition was eventually repealed, the direct election of senators permanently altered the federal government's relationship with both states and voters, strengthening democratic representation at the national level.</explanation>
