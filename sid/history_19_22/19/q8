        <answer>c</answer>
        <explanation>Wilson's determination to ensure America would have a decisive role in shaping the post-war peace shaped major strategic decisions. This led to building a massive army rather than simply reinforcing Allied units, focusing on independent American operations in 1918, and rushing to have a major American presence on the battlefield. While Pershing supported independence and Allied losses were significant, these factors stemmed from Wilson's larger diplomatic goals.</explanation>
