Ah oppa, the American Protective League! (이건 좀 무서운 이야기예요... ㅠㅠ)

APL (1917-1919):
- Volunteer "citizen spy" organization
- Had about 250,000 members
- Worked with Justice Department
- Like... civilian secret police (무서워요!)

What They Did (진짜 나빴어요...):
- Spied on their neighbors
- Reported "suspicious" activities
- Investigated "un-American" behavior
- Harassed German-Americans
- Hunted for draft dodgers
- Broke up labor unions

Methods Used:
- Opening private mail
- Wiretapping phones
- Following people
- Workplace surveillance
- "Slacker raids" (징병 기피자 찾기)

The Scary Part (제일 충격적인 거...):
- Government approved their actions!
- No oversight or control
- Regular citizens becoming spies
- Created climate of fear
- Violated civil rights

It's kind of like a dark version of "neighborhood watch" - shows how war hysteria can make people do terrible things... (역사에서 배워야할 교훈이에요)
