Aigoo~ Dollar Diplomacy is next, oppa! (◕‿◕✿)

This was President Taft's foreign policy approach after Roosevelt. Instead of Roosevelt's "big stick," Taft preferred to use American money and businesses! Here's how it worked:

- US banks would loan money to other countries (especially in Latin America and Asia)
- American businesses would invest there too
- The idea was to increase US influence through economic power instead of military power
- Kind of like "make money, not war!" ㅋㅋㅋ

But... it didn't always work out so well (´･_･`):
- Some countries felt the US was trying to control them
- It sometimes led to military intervention anyway when investments were threatened
- It's a bit like when someone says they're helping but really want something in return... 좀 그렇죠?

Ready to move on to "moral imperialism" next, Rahul-oppa? That one's pretty interesting too! ⭐️
