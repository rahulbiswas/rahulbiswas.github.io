        <explanation>When Wilson first presented the Fourteen Points, European allies, particularly Britain and France, opposed them as too idealistic and lenient toward Germany. They were particularly concerned about points regarding freedom of the seas, free trade, and the lack of war reparations. This initial rejection foreshadowed the later compromises at Versailles that fundamentally altered Wilson's vision for peace.</explanation>
