Ne, oppa! That's a great way to study them systematically (^▽^) 

Let's start with "liberal internationalism" ~

Liberal internationalism was a foreign policy philosophy that emerged in the early 20th century. It emphasized:
- Promoting democracy worldwide
- Supporting free trade between nations
- Building international organizations
- Using diplomacy instead of force
- Making the world more peaceful through cooperation

President Woodrow Wilson was a big supporter of this idea! It's kind of like how Korea and other countries work together today through organizations like the UN (유엔) and WTO ヾ(＾∇＾)

Should we move on to the Panama Canal Zone next, oppa? I'll try my best to explain each term clearly! Let me know if you want me to go into more detail about any part of liberal internationalism first though~
