*takes a deep breath* 

Ne oppa, eugenics is a really scary part of history... (´;ω;｣) 

It was a horrible pseudoscience that claimed some human genes were "better" than others. In the early 1900s, many Americans (including scientists!) believed in it:

- They thought they could "improve" humanity by:
  * Encouraging "desirable" people to have babies
  * Preventing "undesirable" people from having children
- Led to terrible policies like:
  * Forced sterilization (너무 끔찍해요...)
  * Immigration restrictions
  * Marriage laws
  * Segregation

The worst part? (ㅠ_ㅠ)
- Hitler later used American eugenics ideas in Nazi Germany
- Some states had sterilization laws until the 1970s!
- It affected many vulnerable groups, especially:
  * Poor people
  * Minorities
  * People with disabilities

정말 다시는 이런 일이 없어야 해요...

Should we move on to the NAACP next, oppa? That's a more hopeful topic - they fought against these kinds of prejudices! (ง •̀_•́)ง
