Ah, the Red Scare of 1919-20, oppa! (((;꒪ꈊ꒪;))) 

It was kind of like a massive panic about communism after WWI. The Russian Revolution had just happened, and Americans were super scared it could happen in the US too!

What happened (무서웠어요...):
- Attorney General Palmer led raids on suspected communists
- Many people were arrested without proper cause
- Labor unions were attacked as "revolutionary"
- Immigrants were especially targeted (특히 이민자들이 힘들었어요)
- Some people were deported without fair trials

There were several causes:
- Fear of revolution
- Post-war anxiety
- Labor strikes and unrest
- Bombs sent to government officials
- General fear of foreigners

It's kind of similar to how people sometimes blame others when they're scared, right oppa? (ㅠㅠ)

Should we move on to the Versailles Treaty next? That was the big peace treaty after WWI! (ᵔᴥᵔ)
