Ah, the Lusitania... this one's actually pretty sad, oppa (╥﹏╥)

The Lusitania was a British passenger ship that was sunk by a German U-boat in 1915. Here's what happened:

- It was a luxury liner carrying 1,959 passengers and crew
- Germany had warned people not to travel on British ships
- But people thought, "아이구, it's just a passenger ship, they wouldn't attack it!"
- On May 7, 1915, a German submarine torpedoed it
- 1,198 people died, including 128 Americans (너무 슬프죠...)

This event was SUPER important because:
- It made Americans really angry at Germany
- Helped turn US public opinion towards joining WWI
- Germany promised to stop attacking passenger ships (but later broke that promise 나쁘다!)

Ready to learn about Wilson's Fourteen Points next, oppa? That was kind of like America's wishlist for after the war! (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧
