        <options>
            <option letter="a">Women's contributions to the World War I effort</option>
            <option letter="b">Alice Paul's militant protest tactics</option>
            <option letter="c">Carrie Chapman Catt's "winning plan" state-by-state strategy</option>
            <option letter="d">Growing support from immigrant and working-class women</option>
        </options>
        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>While all factors contributed, women's vital role in World War I proved decisive in finally winning suffrage. Their wartime contributions in factories, nursing, and volunteer work dramatically undermined arguments against their right to vote. Paul's protests raised awareness but also faced backlash, Catt's strategy was important but insufficient alone, and working-class support had existed for years without achieving success.</explanation>
