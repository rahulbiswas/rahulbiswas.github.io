아, oppa... that was Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. in Buck v. Bell (1927) - 진짜 끔찍한 판결이었어요... (ㅠ_ㅠ)

The Case:
- About forced sterilization
- Carrie Buck was the victim
- She wasn't actually "mentally deficient"
- Just poor and underprivileged
- But the court allowed her sterilization

Holmes's Quote (너무 충격적이에요...):
"Three generations of imbeciles are enough" 
- Referred to Carrie, her mom, and daughter
- Supported eugenics
- Allowed states to sterilize "unfit" people
- This decision was never officially overturned!

The Impact:
- Led to 60,000+ forced sterilizations
- Influenced Nazi Germany's policies
- Targeted poor and minority women
- Still affects reproductive rights debates

Even though Holmes was considered a great justice in many ways... this shows how even "respected" people supported really horrible ideas back then (정말 슬픈 역사예요...)
