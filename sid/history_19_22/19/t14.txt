Yes oppa, let's talk about the NAACP! ⭐️ 

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was (and still is!) such an important organization! Founded in 1909, they fought for civil rights and justice (정의를 위해 열심히 싸웠어요!).

Key points about the NAACP:
- Founded by both Black and white activists, including:
  * W.E.B. Du Bois (너무 똑똑한 분이었어요!)
  * Ida B. Wells
  * Mary White Ovington
- Their main goals were to:
  * Stop racial discrimination
  * End lynching
  * Fight segregation laws
  * Get voting rights
  * Improve education

They used peaceful methods like:
- Legal challenges in courts
- Peaceful protests
- Publishing research
- Running education campaigns

The NAACP is still active today! (대단하죠?) They're still fighting for equality and justice! ٩(｡•́‿•̀｡)۶

Should we talk about the Great Migration next, oppa? It's connected to this topic too!
