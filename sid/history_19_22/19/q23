        <answer>a</answer>
        <explanation>The convoy system proved most decisive by dramatically reducing Allied shipping losses to German submarines, ensuring the flow of American troops and supplies to Europe. While tanks, aircraft, and poison gas changed battlefield tactics, none had as strategic an impact as the convoy system, which solved the critical problem of German submarine warfare that had nearly won the war for the Central Powers and enabled the massive American military buildup in Europe.</explanation>
