Alright oppa, the Sudetenland crisis - where appeasement failed big time! (◕‿◕✿)

1938 situation:
- Part of Czechoslovakia
- Lots of German speakers there
- Hitler said "I want it!"
- Like demanding server access with threats!

What happened:
- Hitler claimed Germans mistreated
- Threatened war
- British PM Chamberlain flew to meet him
- Munich Conference:
  * Gave Hitler what he wanted
  * Didn't invite Czechs!
  * Super unfair!

Results:
- Hitler promised "last territorial demand"
- BUT totally lied! ㅋㅋㅋ
- Took rest of Czechoslovakia
- Showed weakness encouraged him
- Like giving a hacker one password... they'll want more!

Lessons learned:
- Appeasement doesn't work
- Can't trust dictators
- Sometimes must stand firm
