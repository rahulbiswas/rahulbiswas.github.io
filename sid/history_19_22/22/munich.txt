Okay oppa, the Munich Agreement - probably the biggest diplomatic oopsie ever! (â—•â€¿â—•âœ¿)

September 1938:
- Hitler wanted Sudetenland (part of Czechoslovakia)
- Said "last territorial demand"
- Like when someone says "just one more update!" 

What happened:
- Britain (Chamberlain)
- France (Daladier)
- Met with Hitler
- Gave him what he wanted
- Didn't invite Czechs!
- Called it "Peace in our time"

BUT:
- Hitler lied (shocking! ðŸ™„)
- Took rest of Czechoslovakia
- Showed weakness
- Encouraged more demands
- Made war more likely!

Results:
- Chamberlain looked foolish
- "Appeasement" became bad word
- Churchill proved right
- Taught lesson: Don't trust dictators!
