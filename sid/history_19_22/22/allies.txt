Ne, let's talk about the Allies! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

The Allies (or Allied Powers) were the countries that fought against the Axis in WW2:
- Main Allied Powers included:
  * United States (after Pearl Harbor)
  * Great Britain (from the start!)
  * Soviet Union (after Hitler broke their pact in 1941)
  * China (fighting Japan)
  * France (though they were occupied early on 😢)

Think of it like a team project, oppa! Each country brought different strengths:
- Britain: Naval power and code-breaking
- USSR: Huge army and eastern front
- US: Industrial might and economic power

재미있죠? (Interesting, right?) The Allies won because of their combined strength and resources! 

Should we move on to "America First" next? It's quite different from what we just discussed~ 

화이팅! You're doing great with remembering these terms! (◕‿◕✿)
