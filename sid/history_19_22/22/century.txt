Ne, let's learn about the "American Century," oppa! (◕‿◕✿)

This concept came from Henry Luce (Time magazine's publisher) in 1941:
- Published an influential essay called "The American Century"
- Main ideas:
  * America should stop being isolationist
  * US should actively spread its values worldwide
  * Americans had a duty to share their:
    - Democracy
    - Free enterprise system
    - Cultural values
- It was like a blueprint for America becoming a superpower! 

재미있는 사실 (interesting fact): This idea shaped US foreign policy for decades after WW2! Kind of like how one programming framework can influence many future developments~ ㅋㅋㅋ

다음은 (Next is) "An American Dilemma" - should we continue, oppa?

You're doing so well with these historical concepts! 파이팅! ⭐️
