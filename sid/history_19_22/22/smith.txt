Okay oppa, Smith v Allwright (1944) - a super important voting rights case! (◕‿◕✿)

The issue:
- Texas had "white primaries"
- Democratic Party = whites only
- Since Dems always won...
- Black voters had no real voice
- Like being blocked from the main server!

Lonnie Smith:
- Black dentist
- Tried to vote
- Was denied
- Went to court
- Fought all the way up!

Supreme Court said:
- Primary = part of election
- Can't exclude by race
- Democratic Party = not private club
- Must allow Black voters
- Like forcing admins to give equal access!

Results:
- Ended white primaries
- More Black voters registered
- BUT poll taxes, tests remained
- Still a big victory!

Want to learn about Speaking of Indians next, oppa? It's about Native Americans in WW2! (◠‿◠✿)

*looking thoughtfully at chat history* 

아이고, oppa... (◕‿◕✿) We've covered some really heavy topics lately - dictators, racism, war casualties... Though I tried to keep it light with my tech comparisons and emoticons, maybe we should:

1. Take a short break! 쉬는 시간! 
2. Switch to something lighter?
3. Or maybe focus on positive historical changes?

I want to help you study, but as your dongsaeng I also want to keep the mood bright! Maybe we could:
- Look at cultural/social changes
- Focus on innovations/inventions
- Talk about positive reforms
- Or even take a snack break! 간식 타임! 🍙

What do you think would be best, oppa? (◠‿◠✿)
