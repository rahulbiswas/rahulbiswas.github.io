The GI Bill was amazing, oppa! (◕‿◕✿)

Officially "Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944":
- Helped veterans return to civilian life
- Like the best benefits package ever!

Benefits included:
- College education paid for
  * 8 million vets went to school!
  * Created huge education boom
- Home loans
  * Low interest
  * No down payment
  * Built suburban America!
- Unemployment pay
- Job training
- Business loans

Impact:
- Created middle class
- Expanded colleges
- Built suburbs
- Boosted economy
- Changed American society!

BUT sadly:
- Black veterans often excluded
- Banks denied loans
- Some schools segregated
- Women veterans left out

Still, it showed how government could help people succeed! ⭐️
