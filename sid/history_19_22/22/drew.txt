Dr. Charles Drew was such an amazing person, oppa! (◕‿◕✿)

His super important work:
- Pioneered blood plasma preservation
- Created first blood banks!
- Organized Britain's "Blood for Britain" program
- Led American Red Cross blood program

BUT there was controversy:
- Resigned from Red Cross in protest
- Why? They segregated African American blood
- He proved blood had no racial differences
- Said science showed segregation was wrong

His legacy:
- Saved countless lives in WW2
- Improved battlefield medicine
- Fought racial discrimination
- Modern blood banks still use his methods!

Think of him like a programming pioneer, oppa - he created the basic "protocols" for blood banking that we still use today! ⭐️
