Ah oppa, the Four Freedoms are much more hopeful! (◕‿◕✿)

FDR announced these in 1941 - his vision for a better world:

1. Freedom of Speech
   * Express opinions
   * No censorship
   * Like being able to post your thoughts freely!

2. Freedom of Worship
   * Practice any religion
   * Or none at all
   * Everyone's beliefs respected

3. Freedom from Want
   * Basic needs met
   * Economic security
   * Like having enough RAM for all programs! ㅋㅋㅋ

4. Freedom from Fear
   * Peace between nations
   * Safe at home
   * No war or violence

Norman Rockwell made famous paintings of these!
- Became popular posters
- Helped explain why we fought
- Still inspire people today

Such a beautiful dream for the future, right? ⭐️
