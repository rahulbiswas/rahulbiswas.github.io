*takes a deep breath* Oppa, this is one of the darkest parts of WW2... (◕‿◕✿)

The "Final Solution" was Nazi Germany's plan to murder all European Jews:
- Started officially in 1942
- Led by Heinrich Himmler
- Used industrial methods:
  * Death camps
  * Gas chambers
  * Crematoria
  * Systematic killing

The process:
- First: segregation/ghettos
- Then: mass shootings
- Finally: death camps like:
  * Auschwitz
  * Treblinka
  * Belzec
  * Sobibor

Results:
- 6 million Jews murdered
- Plus 5 million others:
  * Roma people
  * Soviet POWs
  * Polish civilians
  * Disabled people
  * Many more... 😢

Important to remember so it never happens again... ⭐️

Should we move to the Four Freedoms next, oppa? It's about hope for a better world. (◠‿◠✿)
