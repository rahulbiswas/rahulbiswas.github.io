The Detroit Race Riot of 1943 was really sad, oppa! (◕‿◕✿)

What caused it:
- Detroit booming with war production
- Huge population growth
  * African Americans from South
  * White workers from everywhere
- Limited housing
- Job competition
- Police discrimination

The spark:
- June 20, 1943
- Fight at Belle Isle park
- Rumors spread
- Violence exploded

Results:
- 34 people died
  * 25 African Americans
  * 9 white people
- 433 injured
- 1,800 arrested
- Military had to restore order
- Showed serious racial problems during war

Government response:
- FDR sent federal troops
- Investigated causes
- BUT didn't solve underlying issues:
  * Housing segregation
  * Job discrimination
  * Police brutality

Should we look at Double V Campaign next, oppa? It was African Americans' response to these problems! (◠‿◠✿)
