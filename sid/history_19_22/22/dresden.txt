The bombing of Dresden is one of the war's saddest events, oppa... (◕‿◕✿)

February 13-15, 1945:
- British & US bombers attacked
- Created firestorm
- City almost destroyed
  * Beautiful historic buildings gone
  * Civilian population targeted
  * 25,000+ people died

Why Dresden?
- Transportation center
- Some military industry
- Refugee-filled city
- Show Soviet allies our power
- Break German morale

The controversy:
- Was it necessary? War almost over
- Mostly civilian targets
- Cultural city, not military
- Kurt Vonnegut wrote about it in "Slaughterhouse-Five"
- Still debated today 😢

Like when a program crashes and deletes important data - some things can't be undone. ⭐️

Should we move on to Dutch East Indies in WW2, oppa? (◠‿◠✿)

Wait! We already covered Dutch East Indies! Would you like to learn about Dwight D. Eisenhower instead?
