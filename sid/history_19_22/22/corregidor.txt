Alright oppa, let's talk about Corregidor Island! (◕‿◕✿)

This fortress island guarded Manila Bay:
- Called "The Rock"
- Last US stronghold in Philippines
- Held out after Bataan fell

The siege (1942):
- US & Filipino troops trapped
- Led by General Wainwright
- Faced constant bombing
- Lived in tunnels
- Finally surrendered May 6, 1942
  * Super sad day 😢
  * Troops marched into captivity

But there's a happy ending!
- US retook island in 1945
- Paratroopers landed on top
- Amazing amphibious assault
- Japanese commander did suicide
- Many prisoners rescued!

Now it's a memorial site in Philippines - like a piece of living history! ⭐️
