August 1942 - February 1943:
- Hitler wanted Soviet oil fields
- Stalin said "Not one step back!"
- City became survival game:
  * Fighting house to house
  * Snipers everywhere
  * Even sewers had battles!
  * Like the most hardcore PvP ever!

The numbers were crazy:

- City completely destroyed
- Soldiers fought for single rooms
- Temperatures -30Â°C (-22Â°F)
- Germans trapped and starving

Soviet victory:

- Changed whole war!

Results:
