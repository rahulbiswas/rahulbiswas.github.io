Okay oppa, the Servicemen's Readjustment Act (GI Bill)! (â—•â€¿â—•âœ¿)

The good parts:
- Free college education
- Home loans
- Business loans
- Job training
- Like the best benefits package ever!

Changed America by creating:
- Huge middle class
- College boom
- Suburban growth
- Economic expansion

BUT there were problems:
- Black veterans often excluded
  * Banks denied loans
  * Colleges rejected them
  * Housing discrimination
- Women veterans overlooked
- Like having admin privileges but being blocked from using them! ðŸ˜¢

Still, it helped some:
- More Black college students
- Some economic gains
- Proved education works
- Led to civil rights demands
