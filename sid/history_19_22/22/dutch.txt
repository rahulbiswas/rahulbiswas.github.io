Alright oppa, the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) during WW2! (◕‿◕✿)

Japan wanted it badly because:
- Rich in resources
  * Oil (super important!)
  * Rubber
  * Tin
- Strategic location
- Part of their "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"

What happened:
- Japanese invaded early 1942
- Dutch/Allied forces tried to stop them
- Battle of Java Sea was disaster
  * Allied ships destroyed
  * Japanese won control
- Dutch surrendered March 1942

Under Japanese occupation:
- Harsh military rule
- Forced labor ("romusha")
- Resource extraction
- BUT also:
  * Encouraged independence movement
  * Trained local military
  * Weakened Dutch control

After war:
- Indonesia declared independence
- Dutch tried to return
- Led to independence war
- Finally free in 1949! ⭐️
