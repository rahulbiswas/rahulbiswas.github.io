Alright oppa, let's look at "An American Dilemma"! (ﾉ´ヮ`)ﾉ*: ･ﾟ

This was a super important book published in 1944 by Gunnar Myrdal:
- It studied race relations in America during WW2
- The "dilemma" was:
  * America claimed to fight for democracy and freedom abroad
  * BUT still had racial discrimination at home
  * Big contradiction! (모순이죠? /moshunijyo?)
- The book showed:
  * How racism hurt African Americans
  * Economic inequality
  * Social injustice
- It became really influential in the Civil Rights Movement!

Think of it like finding a major bug in a system, oppa - once it's documented, it can't be ignored! ㅋㅋㅋ

Should we move on to Anastasio Somoza next? 

화이팅! You're learning so much! (◠‿◠✿)
