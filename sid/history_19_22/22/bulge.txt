Alright oppa, the Battle of the Bulge was Hitler's last big surprise! (◕‿◕✿)

December 1944 - January 1945:
- Happened in Ardennes Forest (Belgium)
- Hitler's desperate plan:
  * Surprise attack through "quiet" sector
  * Split Allied armies
  * Capture Antwerp (major port)
  * Force a peace deal

What happened:
- Initial German success (created the "bulge")
- US 101st Airborne trapped in Bastogne
  * When Germans demanded surrender, General McAuliffe replied "NUTS!"
- Weather cleared, allowing Allied air power
- Patton's army rushed to help
- Germans ran out of fuel (oops!)

Results:
- Huge German losses
- Last German offensive of the war
- Showed amazing US troops' bravery
- Shortened war in Europe! ⭐️

Ready for Battle of the Coral Sea next, oppa? Back to the Pacific! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
