Founded in 1942 during WW2:
- Created by students in Chicago
- Used peaceful direct action
- Inspired by Gandhi's methods!
- Mixed-race group

Their WW2 activities:
- Challenged segregated restaurants
- Organized sit-ins
- Protested discrimination
- Highlighted Double V campaign
  * Victory abroad AND at home!

Important because:
- Early civil rights organization
- Showed war's impact on racial justice
- Used techniques later copied by MLK

Think of them like early beta testers for civil rights tactics! ⭐️
