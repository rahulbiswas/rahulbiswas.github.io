Okay oppa, the Sino-Japanese War - it started before WW2! (â—•â€¿â—•âœ¿)

Started 1937:
- Japan invaded China
- Marco Polo Bridge Incident
- Wanted Chinese resources
- Like a hostile takeover attempt!

Horrible events:
- Nanking Massacre ðŸ˜¢
  * 200,000+ civilians killed
  * Really terrible crimes
  * Still affects relations today
- Other atrocities:
  * Unit 731 experiments
  * Comfort women system
  * Cities destroyed

China's response:
- Nationalists (Chiang Kai-shek)
- Communists (Mao)
- Actually worked together!
- Got help from:
  * USSR (early)
  * US (later)
  * Like getting support tickets from different admins!

Lasted until 1945:
- Tied down Japanese army
- Weakened Japan's resources
- Helped Allied victory
- BUT left China devastated
