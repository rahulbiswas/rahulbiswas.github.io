Okay oppa! Let me tell you about A. Philip Randolph! (◠‿◠✿)

A. Philip Randolph was such a powerful civil rights leader during WW2! Here are the key points:
- He was the leader of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (first major Black labor union!)
- In 1941, he organized the March on Washington Movement - threatening to bring 100,000 African Americans to protest discrimination in the defense industry
- His pressure worked! President Roosevelt responded by issuing Executive Order 8802, which:
  * Banned racial discrimination in defense industries
  * Created the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC)
- He continued fighting for civil rights throughout the war with the "Double V" campaign (Victory abroad AND at home!)

와~ Isn't it amazing how one person can make such big changes? (✿'▽')/

Should we move on to "Allies" next, oppa? 

Remember this for your test - Randolph's actions show how WW2 helped advance civil rights! ⭐️
