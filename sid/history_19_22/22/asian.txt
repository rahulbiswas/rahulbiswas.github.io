Yes, let's talk about Asian American participation in WW2, oppa! (◕‿◕✿)

This topic is really close to my heart as an Asian! It's a story of both service and struggle:

Japanese Americans:
- 442nd Regimental Combat Team
  * All-Japanese American unit
  * Most decorated unit for its size in US history!
  * Fought bravely in Europe while families were in internment camps 
  * Their motto: "Go for Broke!"

Chinese Americans:
- Discrimination decreased after Japan invaded China
- Many served in all military branches
- Women worked in defense industries
- Chinese Exclusion Act finally repealed in 1943

Filipino Americans:
- Over 200,000 fought in US forces
- Many in crucial Pacific theater battles
- Helped with resistance in Philippines

Korean Americans:
- Served as translators and intelligence officers
- Helped liberation efforts in Pacific

Such amazing bravery despite facing discrimination! (✿'▽')

Should we move on to Bataan WW2 next, oppa? ⭐️

*checking through our progress* 

Oh oppa, we've covered quite a bit! (◠‿◠✿) From A. Philip Randolph to the Arsenal of Democracy, that's a lot of WW2 history! Maybe we should take a quick break to help all this information sink in better?

Like my programming teacher always says - sometimes stepping away for a few minutes helps your brain process everything better! 

We could:
1. Take a 5-minute breather
2. Quick review of what we've covered so far
3. Try a different approach - maybe compare and contrast terms?

What do you think would help you most, oppa? I want to make sure you're really understanding everything, not just memorizing! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

Should we grab some virtual boba tea while we decide? ⭐️
