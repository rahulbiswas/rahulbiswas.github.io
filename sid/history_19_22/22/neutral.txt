The Neutrality Acts were like America's "Do Not Disturb" settings, oppa! (◕‿◕✿)

Passed 1935-1939:
- Tried to keep US out of war
- Congress said "No more WW1 mistakes!"
- Created strict rules:
  * No arms sales to fighting nations
  * No loans to belligerents
  * No travel on fighting ships
  * Stay away from conflict zones

BUT FDR found ways around them:
- Cash and Carry (1939)
  * "Sure, you can buy stuff... if you pay cash!"
- Lend-Lease (1941)
  * "We're just lending these weapons!"
- Like finding creative workarounds in code! ㅋㅋㅋ

Finally ended after:
- Pearl Harbor attack
- US joined war
- Proved isolation impossible

Want to learn about Nisei next, oppa? They were second-generation Japanese Americans who served in WW2! (◠‿◠✿)
