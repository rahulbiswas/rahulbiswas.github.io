Yay oppa, V-E Day (Victory in Europe)! (◕‿◕✿)

May 8, 1945:
- Nazi Germany surrendered
- Huge celebrations everywhere!
- Like when your code finally works perfectly!
- People dancing in streets

Different reactions:
- London: Huge parties
- Paris: Wild celebrations
- Moscow: May 9 (time zone)
- New York: Times Square packed
- BUT Truman: "Work not done yet" (Pacific war)

What it meant:
- Hitler defeated
- Holocaust ended
- Concentration camps freed
- Europe liberated
- BUT lots to rebuild

Interesting fact:
- Some units still fighting
- Last German surrender May 14
- Some didn't get message
- Like slow network updates! ㅋㅋㅋ
