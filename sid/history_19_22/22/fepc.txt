Okay oppa, let's talk about the Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC)! (◕‿◕✿)

Created with Executive Order 8802:
- First federal agency for workplace equality
- Goal: Stop discrimination in war industries
- Like a moderator making sure everyone plays fair!

What it did:
- Investigated complaints
- Held hearings
- Monitored hiring
- Pushed companies to integrate
- Helped minorities & women get better jobs

Successes:
- Opened defense jobs to African Americans
- Supported women workers
- Created precedent for equal employment
- Showed discrimination could be fought!

BUT had problems:
- No power to punish violations
- Limited budget
- Southern states resisted
- Ended after war (1946)

Still, it was a start toward workplace equality! ⭐️
