Let's talk about Clement Attlee, oppa! (◕‿◕✿)

He was Britain's surprise leader after WW2:
- Replaced Winston Churchill in July 1945
- Labour Party won huge election victory
- Right in the middle of Potsdam Conference!
  * Had to take Churchill's place with Truman & Stalin
  * Talk about a tough first day at work! 

Why he won:
- British wanted post-war changes
- Promised welfare state
- People respected him as Deputy PM during war
- Churchill great for war, Attlee better for peace

What he did:
- Created National Health Service (NHS)
- Nationalized major industries
- Started British nuclear program
- Helped create NATO
- Managed India's independence

Fun fact: Churchill was shocked by the loss - like when your code works perfectly in testing but crashes in production! ⭐️
