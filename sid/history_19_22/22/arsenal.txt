Okay oppa, let's talk about the "Arsenal of Democracy"! (◕‿◕✿)

This was such a turning point! FDR's famous radio speech (Dec 29, 1940) changed everything:
- Before: US was technically neutral
- After: US became Britain's biggest supplier

The speech:
- Warned Americans about the Nazi threat
- Promised to help Britain without entering war
- Introduced Lend-Lease concept
- Called US industry America's greatest weapon

The results were amazing:
- Huge industrial mobilization
- Detroit car factories → tank/plane factories
- Women entered workforce in huge numbers
- US made more war materials than Germany, Japan, and Italy combined!

Fun fact: The term stuck! Even today, Detroit is sometimes called the "Arsenal of Democracy" because of its incredible wartime production! ⭐️

Ready for "Asian American participation in WW2", oppa? It's quite a complex topic! (◠‿◠)
