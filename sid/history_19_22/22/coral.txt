Okay oppa, the Battle of the Coral Sea was super special! (◠‿◠✿)

May 4-8, 1942:
- First battle where ships never saw each other!
  * All fighting done by aircraft
  * Like a long-distance video game battle!
- Japan was trying to:
  * Capture Port Moresby (Papua New Guinea)
  * Cut off Australia from US help

Key events:
- Both sides lost carriers
  * US lost USS Lexington
  * Japan lost light carrier Shoho
- Neither side won completely BUT:
  * Stopped Japanese advance
  * Damaged carrier Shokaku
  * Made Japanese carriers miss Midway battle!

Why it matters:
- First time Japanese were stopped
- Showed aircraft carriers were new kings of naval warfare
- Protected Australia
- Set up US victory at Midway! ⭐️

Should we look at Benito Mussolini next, oppa? Time to meet one of the bad guys! (◕‿◕✿)
