Labor Movements 1920-1932

The labor movement faced significant challenges during the 1920s as business interests and government policies weakened union power. The "American Plan" promoted by employers emphasized individual contracts over collective bargaining. Union membership declined from about 5 million in 1920 to 3.4 million by 1929. The Great Depression then created new pressures while spurring renewed activism.

Strike activity encountered fierce resistance. The 1922 railroad shop workers' strike saw widespread violence and injunctions. Steel companies maintained strong anti-union policies. Coal mining strikes faced military intervention. Employers routinely used strikebreakers, private security forces, and court injunctions to defeat labor actions. Violence frequently resulted from these confrontations.

Legal restrictions hampered union activities. Supreme Court decisions limited picketing and boycotts. The Clayton Act's labor provisions proved ineffective. State courts readily issued anti-strike injunctions. Federal courts generally favored employer interests. These legal barriers complicated organizing efforts.

Communist influence created internal conflicts. Some unions expelled communist members and leaders. The Trade Union Educational League sparked controversies. Ideological disputes divided the labor movement. Anti-communist campaigns often targeted labor activists. These divisions weakened organized labor's effectiveness.

The American Federation of Labor maintained conservative policies. Samuel Gompers's death in 1924 brought William Green's leadership. The AFL continued focusing on skilled craft workers. Industrial workers remained largely unorganized. This approach limited union growth in mass production industries.

Working conditions deteriorated during the Depression. Wage cuts became widespread. Unemployment reached catastrophic levels. Working hours increased for those still employed. Safety conditions worsened. These conditions created pressure for more militant labor action.

New organizing strategies emerged. Industrial unions gained support. Women workers organized in textile and garment industries. African American workers joined unions in greater numbers. These developments laid groundwork for 1930s labor advances.

Labor's political influence declined. Pro-business Republicans dominated government. Labor law enforcement weakened. State and local governments often opposed unions. However, some progressive politicians maintained labor support. The Depression gradually shifted political attitudes.

Company unions expanded as alternatives to independent unions. Employers promoted these organizations to prevent outside unionization. Some provided limited benefits while restricting worker rights. This strategy effectively limited independent union growth in many industries.

Mexican and Mexican-American workers faced special challenges. Deportation campaigns targeted labor activists. Agricultural workers remained largely unorganized. Border controls affected labor organizing. These issues complicated union efforts in the Southwest.

The labor press maintained important influence. Union newspapers and magazines continued publishing. Labor radio programs reached new audiences. These media helped maintain worker solidarity despite organizational weakness.

Women's role in labor movements evolved. Female union membership increased in some industries. Women led important strikes and organizing efforts. However, many unions remained male-dominated. Gender discrimination persisted in union structures.

Youth labor issues gained attention. Child labor remained widespread despite reform efforts. Young workers faced exploitation and dangerous conditions. The Depression increased pressure on young workers. These concerns sparked continued reform efforts.

Labor education programs developed. Worker education centers opened. Union-sponsored training expanded. These efforts built long-term organizing capacity while maintaining labor culture during difficult times.

The period's experiences influenced later labor movements. Lessons from defeats shaped future strategies. Networks of activists persisted. Industrial union supporters gained experience. These developments contributed to later labor advances.
