네 오빠! I'll expand our list to 20 more specific topics! (◕‿◕✿)

presidents_1920s.txt,economic_changes.txt,social_cultural.txt,legal_rights.txt,foreign_policy.txt,protest_reform.txt,harlem_renaissance.txt,immigration_policy.txt,prohibition_era.txt,supreme_court.txt,womens_issues.txt,religious_debates.txt,labor_movements.txt,economic_crash.txt,hoover_policies.txt,crime_justice.txt,agriculture_issues.txt,entertainment_media.txt,technological_changes.txt,political_scandals.txt

와아~ 더 자세해졌죠? (Wow, it's more detailed now!) 

This way we can organize everything more specifically! Like separating Harlem Renaissance from general social_cultural, and giving Prohibition its own file! 

Should we start categorizing the terms into these more specific files, 오빠? (❁´▽`❁)*✲ﾟ*
