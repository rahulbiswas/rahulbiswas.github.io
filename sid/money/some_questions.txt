Of course oppa! (◠‿◠✿) I'll make a practice quiz to help test your understanding~

📝 **Practice Questions**

1. Q: If someone deposits $1000 cash in their checking account, what's the immediate effect on the money supply?
   A: No change! The money just changes form from cash to demand deposits.

2. Q: With a 10% reserve ratio, what's the money multiplier?
   A: 1/0.10 = 10 (The banking system can create $10 of new money for each $1 deposited)

3. Q: A bank has $10,000 in deposits and a 20% reserve ratio. What are their required reserves?
   A: $10,000 × 0.20 = $2,000 in required reserves

4. Q: If the Fed buys $100 in bonds from the public, what happens?
   A: Money supply increases by $100 immediately (can increase more through multiplier effect)

5. Q: What's the difference between M1 and M2?
   A: M2 includes M1 plus less liquid assets like savings accounts and money market accounts

6. Q: Bank has $5000 in total reserves, $4000 in required reserves. What's their lending capacity?
   A: Excess reserves = $1000 ($5000 - $4000), so lending capacity is $1000

7. Q: True or False: When banks make loans, they create new deposits?
   A: True! This is how banks "create" money

Remember:
- Always check if question asks for immediate vs potential effects
- Watch those reserve ratios carefully!
- Double-check your multiplier calculations
