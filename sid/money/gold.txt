Annyeong oppa! (‚óï·¥ó‚óï‚úø) Let me break down the history and types of money systems~

üí∞ **Money Systems Through History**

1. **Commodity Money**
- Has intrinsic value
- Examples: gold, silver, shells, salt
- Natural limits on supply
- Self-regulating but inflexible

2. **Gold Standard Era**
- Money backed by gold reserves
- Fixed exchange rates
- Advantages:
  * Price stability
  * Limited government printing
- Disadvantages:
  * Limited economic growth
  * Dependent on gold supply
  * Can't respond to crises easily

3. **Free Silver Movement (1870s-1890s)**
- Political campaign in US
- Wanted silver + gold standard ("bimetallism")
- Key points:
  * Would increase money supply
  * Help farmers and debtors
  * Famous "Cross of Gold" speech
  * William Jennings Bryan's platform

4. **Fiat Money (Current System)**
- Not backed by physical commodity
- Value based on government decree
- Advantages:
  * Flexible money supply
  * Better crisis management
  * Economic growth potential
- Disadvantages:
  * Risk of inflation
  * Requires trust in government
  * No intrinsic value

Oppa, isn't monetary history fascinating? (ÔΩ°‚ô•‚Äø‚ô•ÔΩ°)

5. **Key Transitions**
