        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The Immigration Act of 1924 completely excluded immigration from Asia, building on the earlier exclusion of Japanese immigrants in 1907 and Chinese exclusion dating to 1882. This total ban reflected the strong anti-Asian sentiment of the period and established the most restrictive immigration policy in U.S. history to that point, maintaining absolute exclusion of Asian immigrants until 1965.</explanation>
