            <option letter="d">The success of voluntary cooperation</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Hoover's belief in "American Individualism," which emphasized voluntary cooperation and limited government intervention, proved inadequate in face of the Great Depression's unprecedented severity. His ideological commitment to self-reliance and opposition to direct federal aid conflicted with the reality that private charity and local efforts alone could not address the crisis's massive scale.</explanation>

        </options>

        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Richard Whitney, vice president of the New York Stock Exchange, attempted to stop the market panic on October 24, 1929 ("Black Thursday") by dramatically purchasing large blocks of U.S. Steel shares at above-market prices. This visible display was meant to restore investor confidence, but ultimately failed to prevent the crash, which continued through "Black Tuesday" and helped trigger the Great Depression.</explanation>
    </question>
<question number="9">
        <prompt>The U.S. policy in Nicaragua during the 1920s demonstrated:</prompt>

        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>U.S. policy in Nicaragua during the 1920s exemplified military intervention and financial control in Latin America. The presence of U.S. Marines (1912-1933), control over Nicaragua's finances, and support for pro-American leaders demonstrated the continued implementation of "dollar diplomacy" and military intervention. This policy sparked nationalist resistance, particularly from Augusto Sandino's guerrilla movement.</explanation>

        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The term "Lost Generation" was popularized through Ernest Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises," where he quoted Gertrude Stein. It referred to the generation that came of age during World War I, particularly writers and artists who felt disillusioned by the war's brutality. The term captured their sense of moral loss, disorientation, and rejection of traditional American values in the post-war period.</explanation>

        <explanation>Milo Reno led the Farmers' Holiday Movement during the Great Depression, organizing farmers to withhold their products from market in protest of low agricultural prices. The movement, which began in 1932, included direct action such as blocking roads to prevent farm products from reaching markets, reflecting the desperate situation of American farmers during the Depression.</explanation>

<question number="13">
        <prompt>Hoover's statement that "the tide has turned" in 1930:</prompt>
        <options>
            <option letter="a">Accurately predicted economic recovery</option>
            <option letter="b">Demonstrated his misunderstanding of the Depression's severity</option>
            <option letter="c">Referred to international relations</option>
            <option letter="d">Announced new relief programs</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>When Hoover declared "the tide has turned" in 1930, he severely misjudged the Great Depression's depth and duration. This statement, made as the economic crisis was actually worsening, damaged his credibility and became symbolic of his administration's failure to recognize and effectively address the Depression's severity. The economy continued to deteriorate for several more years.</explanation>

<question number="14">
        <prompt>The Immigration Act of 1924's quota system was designed to:</prompt>

            <option letter="c">Increase Asian immigration</option>
            <option letter="d">Welcome Southern Europeans</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The Immigration Act of 1924's quota system was specifically designed to favor immigrants from Northern and Western Europe while severely restricting immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. It completely excluded immigrants from Asia and set quotas based on 2% of each nationality's population in the 1890 census, deliberately choosing a year before large-scale immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe began.</explanation>

            <option letter="d">Avoiding racial topics</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Harlem Renaissance writers demonstrated diversity in their approaches to expressing African American experience. While Countee Cullen used traditional poetic forms, Langston Hughes embraced vernacular language and jazz rhythms. Claude McKay combined militant themes with classical sonnets. These varying approaches reflected different views on how to best express African American identity and experience in literature.</explanation>
    </question>
<question number="16">
        <prompt>The impact of Hoover's statement "prosperity is just around the corner" was:</prompt>

            <option letter="d">Encouraging international trade</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Hoover's optimistic statement that "prosperity is just around the corner" severely damaged his credibility as the Depression worsened. Like his similar assertion that "the tide has turned," this statement demonstrated his failure to recognize the Depression's severity and contributed to public perception that he was out of touch with the suffering of ordinary Americans during the economic crisis.</explanation>
    </question>
<question number="17">
        <prompt>The Washington Naval Arms Conference of 1921-1922 achieved:</prompt>

            <option letter="d">Increased naval spending</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The Washington Naval Conference resulted in the Five-Power Treaty, which established a 5:5:3:1.75:1.75 ratio of naval strength between the United States, Britain, Japan, France, and Italy respectively. This agreement temporarily limited naval armaments and helped reduce military spending among major powers. The conference represented a significant diplomatic effort to prevent a naval arms race in the post-WWI period.</explanation>

            <option letter="b">Embrace of vernacular language and jazz rhythms</option>
            <option letter="c">Support for racial equality</option>
            <option letter="d">Interest in African American themes</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>While both Hughes and Cullen wrote about African American experiences, their styles differed significantly. Hughes deliberately embraced black vernacular language, jazz rhythms, and blues influences in his poetry, while Cullen preferred traditional European poetic forms. This stylistic difference reflected broader debates within the Harlem Renaissance about African American artistic expression.</explanation>
    </question>
<question number="19">
        <prompt>Calvin Coolidge's famous statement "the chief business of the American people is business" reflected:</prompt>

            <option letter="d">Progressive reform agenda</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Coolidge's statement epitomized his administration's pro-business, laissez-faire philosophy. It reflected his belief that government should maintain a hands-off approach to business, reduce regulations, and lower taxes. This approach characterized the Republican administrations of the 1920s, promoting what they saw as a partnership between government and business that emphasized minimal interference in the economy.</explanation>
    </question>
<question number="20">
        <prompt>The Sheppard-Towner Act's repeal in 1929 reflected:</prompt>

            <option letter="b">Conservative opposition to federal welfare programs</option>
            <option letter="c">Improved maternal health conditions</option>
            <option letter="d">Support for women's rights</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The Sheppard-Towner Act's repeal, despite its success in reducing maternal and infant mortality, demonstrated growing conservative opposition to federal welfare programs in the 1920s. Critics labeled it "socialistic" and an intrusion into states' rights. The repeal exemplified the decade's resistance to government social welfare initiatives and marked a setback for progressive reform efforts.</explanation>
    </question>

            <option letter="d">Economic relief measures</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The Hoover administration's violent response to the Bonus Army, using military forces led by General MacArthur to evict peaceful WWI veterans and their families from Washington D.C., demonstrated the government's harsh approach to protest during the Depression. The use of tanks and troops against veterans seeking early payment of their service bonuses severely damaged Hoover's public image and symbolized his administration's insensitivity to suffering Americans.</explanation>

            <option letter="d">Government spending should increase</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>As Treasury Secretary, Andrew Mellon's "scientific taxation" theory argued that lowering tax rates on wealthy Americans and businesses would stimulate economic growth and ultimately increase government revenue. This approach, similar to later "supply-side economics," led to significant tax cuts during the 1920s and reflected the pro-business policies of Republican administrations during this period.</explanation>
    </question>
<question number="24">
        <prompt>The Wickersham Commission's report on Prohibition revealed:</prompt>

        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The Wickersham Commission's 1931 report revealed widespread problems with Prohibition enforcement, including corruption, increased crime, and public resistance. However, despite documenting these serious issues, the commission paradoxically opposed repeal of the 18th Amendment. This contradictory position reflected the growing recognition of Prohibition's failure while maintaining official support for the policy.</explanation>

            <option letter="d">Scientific consensus</option>
        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The extensive media coverage of the 1925 Scopes Trial, particularly H.L. Mencken's satirical reporting, highlighted the growing cultural divide between urban and rural America. Urban newspapers often portrayed the trial as a conflict between modern scientific thinking and rural religious fundamentalism, mocking small-town values and religious beliefs while emphasizing the cultural gap between metropolitan and rural communities.</explanation>

        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Alfred E. Smith's 1928 presidential campaign faced significant opposition primarily because he was Catholic and opposed Prohibition. His Catholicism sparked anti-Catholic prejudice, particularly in rural Protestant areas, while his "wet" stance on Prohibition alienated temperance supporters. His urban background and cultural identity as a New Yorker also contributed to his decisive loss to Herbert Hoover.</explanation>

This approach, similar to later "supply-side economics," led to significant tax cuts during the 1920s and reflected the pro-business policies of Republican administrations during this period.</explanation>

Justice Holmes ruled that speech creating a clear and present danger of substantive evils could be restricted, using the famous example that falsely shouting "fire" in a crowded theater was not protected speech. This decision established important limits on First Amendment protections during national security crises.</explanation>

        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Meyer v. Nebraska established that states cannot prohibit the teaching of foreign languages in schools. The Supreme Court ruled that Nebraska's law banning foreign language instruction violated the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause, protecting teachers' right to teach and parents' right to control their children's education. This decision limited states' power to restrict educational and cultural rights.</explanation>

        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The violent dispersal of the Bonus Army, WWI veterans peacefully protesting for early payment of their service bonuses, revealed the Hoover administration's harsh response to social protest during the Depression. The use of military forces, led by General MacArthur, to drive out veterans and their families from Washington D.C. severely damaged Hoover's public image and exemplified his administration's failure to address the human costs of the Depression.</explanation>

        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The term "Hooverville" emerged as a bitter, ironic reference to the makeshift shanty towns built by homeless and unemployed Americans during the Great Depression. Named mockingly after President Hoover, whom many blamed for the crisis, these settlements of cardboard boxes and scrap materials became powerful symbols of the Depression's human toll and Hoover's perceived inability to address the economic crisis effectively.</explanation>

        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Harding's "return to normalcy" policy meant scaling back the federal government's role in the economy after World War I's extensive government intervention. This included lowering taxes, reducing regulations on business, limiting immigration, and generally promoting a pro-business environment. However, this hands-off approach also enabled corruption within his administration, leading to scandals like Teapot Dome.</explanation>

        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The RFC, established in 1932, exemplified Hoover's approach to fighting the Depression through indirect aid. Rather than providing direct relief to individuals, it made loans to banks, railroads, and other businesses, reflecting Hoover's belief that helping financial institutions would eventually benefit the broader economy through a "trickle-down" effect. This approach proved inadequate for addressing the Depression's severity.</explanation>

The collapse in stock values led to bank failures as loans went unpaid, businesses closing due to lack of capital and declining consumer spending, and a general loss of confidence in the economic system. These cascading effects helped transform the crash into the Great Depression, affecting all sectors of society.</explanation>

U.S. Marines were stationed there from 1912 to 1933, ostensibly to protect American interests and maintain stability. This intervention faced resistance from Nicaraguan nationalists, particularly Augusto Sandino, who led a guerrilla campaign against U.S. presence.</explanation>

He argued that lower taxes on the rich would stimulate economic growth and increase government revenue. His policies epitomized the pro-business Republican administrations of the 1920s and contributed to growing economic inequality before the Great Depression.</explanation>

        <explanation>Coolidge's famous statement encapsulated his administration's pro-business, hands-off approach to government. This philosophy manifested in policies that reduced regulations, lowered taxes on businesses and wealthy individuals, and limited government intervention in the economy. His presidency (1923-1929) exemplified the conservative, business-friendly political climate of the "Roaring Twenties."</explanation>

        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>While the Indian Citizenship Act granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans born within U.S. territory, its practical impact was limited by state-level restrictions on voting rights. Many states continued to deny Native Americans voting rights through various measures such as literacy tests, poll taxes, and other discriminatory practices. Full voting rights for Native Americans were not achieved in all states until the 1950s.</explanation>

Written during the "Red Summer" of 1919, when racial violence swept across numerous American cities, the poem became an anthem of resistance against oppression. Its militant tone and classical form demonstrated both the political and artistic achievements of the Harlem Renaissance.</explanation>

        <explanation>The Wickersham Commission, appointed by President Hoover, released its report in 1931 documenting the failures of Prohibition enforcement and the rise in criminal activity. However, despite acknowledging these problems, the commission paradoxically opposed repeal of the 18th Amendment. This contradictory position reflected the growing public recognition of Prohibition's failure while maintaining official support for the policy.</explanation>

        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>U.S. policy in Nicaragua during the 1920s involved direct military occupation and financial control. The presence of U.S. Marines (1912-1933) and control over Nicaragua's finances demonstrated the continuation of "dollar diplomacy" and military intervention. This policy sparked nationalist resistance, particularly from Augusto Sandino's guerrilla movement, and led to the later establishment of the Somoza dictatorship.</explanation>

        <explanation>United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind (1923) challenged the racial definition of "white" for citizenship eligibility. Though Indians were technically classified as Caucasian, the Supreme Court ruled they were not "white" in the common understanding and thus ineligible for naturalized citizenship. This decision reflected the period's racial prejudices and further restricted Asian immigration and citizenship rights.</explanation>

The Court ruled it unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment's due process clause, reflecting its commitment to "freedom of contract" and opposition to government regulation of business. This decision exemplified the conservative Court's protection of business interests.</explanation>

        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>Hoover's philosophy of "American Individualism" led to a limited response to the Great Depression. His belief in voluntary cooperation, self-reliance, and minimal government intervention prevented him from implementing direct federal relief measures. This ideological commitment to individualism and opposition to direct federal aid proved inadequate for addressing the Depression's unprecedented severity.</explanation>

With American backing, Somoza consolidated control over Nicaragua's National Guard and established a dictatorship. This began a family dynasty that would control Nicaragua until 1979, representing U.S. willingness to support authoritarian allies in Latin America.</explanation>

        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The RFC's effectiveness was limited by its focus on indirect aid through loans to banks, railroads, and corporations rather than direct assistance to individuals.

This banking crisis affected American banks that had made loans to European nations, contributing to the international financial crisis and deepening the Great Depression.</explanation>

        </options>
        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The 1923 Adkins v. Children's Hospital decision reflected the Supreme Court's conservative support for business interests. By striking down a minimum wage law for women workers in Washington D.C., the Court demonstrated its commitment to "freedom of contract" and opposition to government regulation of business. This decision exemplified the pro-business orientation of the Supreme Court during the 1920s.</explanation>

        <explanation>The 1928 Olmstead v. United States decision established that wiretapping without a warrant did not violate the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches because there was no physical intrusion into private property. This ruling gave law enforcement significant latitude in conducting electronic surveillance, particularly during Prohibition enforcement, and remained the legal standard until being overturned in 1967.</explanation>

By raising U.S. tariffs to record-high levels on over 20,000 imported goods, it prompted other countries to impose their own high tariffs. This cycle of protectionism contributed to the deepening and spreading of the Great Depression globally.</explanation>

        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>In Olmstead v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that wiretapping without a warrant did not violate the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Court held that wiretaps did not constitute a physical invasion of property and therefore were not "searches." This decision shaped privacy rights and law enforcement practices during Prohibition, though it was later overturned in 1967.</explanation>
