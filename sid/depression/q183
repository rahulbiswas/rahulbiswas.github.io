        <explanation>The 1929 repeal of the Sheppard-Towner Act, which had provided federal funding for maternal and child healthcare, demonstrated growing conservative opposition to federal welfare programs. Despite the program's success in reducing infant mortality, it was attacked as "socialistic" and an intrusion into states' rights. The repeal reflected the 1920s resistance to government involvement in social welfare programs.</explanation>
