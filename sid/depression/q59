        <explanation>The Somoza family's rise to power in Nicaragua was enabled by U.S. support and the 1934 assassination of nationalist leader Augusto Sandino, orchestrated by Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a. After eliminating this opposition, Somoza established a dictatorship with American backing. This began a family dynasty that would control Nicaragua until 1979, symbolizing U.S. tolerance of authoritarian allies during the Cold War era.</explanation>
