        <explanation>In Schenck v. United States (1919), the Supreme Court established the "clear and present danger" test for limiting free speech. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that speech creating a clear and present danger of substantive evils could be restricted, using the famous example that falsely shouting "fire" in a crowded theater was not protected speech. This case significantly impacted First Amendment interpretations.</explanation>
