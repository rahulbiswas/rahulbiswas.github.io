        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>The Wickersham Commission's 1931 report documented widespread problems with Prohibition enforcement, including corruption, increased crime, and public resistance. However, despite acknowledging these serious issues, the commission paradoxically opposed repeal of the 18th Amendment. This contradictory position reflected the growing recognition of Prohibition's failure while maintaining official support for the policy.</explanation>
