        <answer>b</answer>
        <explanation>When Hoover declared "the tide has turned" in 1930, he severely misjudged the Great Depression's depth and duration. This statement, made as the economic crisis was actually worsening, damaged his credibility and became symbolic of his administration's failure to recognize and effectively address the Depression's severity. The economy continued to deteriorate for several more years.</explanation>
