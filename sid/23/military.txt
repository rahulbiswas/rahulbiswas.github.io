Now let's look at Military Desegregation, oppa! (ᵔᴥᵔ) This was such an important step for equality!

Military Desegregation (1948):

1. Executive Order 9981:
- Signed by President Truman
- July 26, 1948 (중요한 날!)
- Ordered equality in the armed forces
- No more discrimination based on race

2. Why It Happened:
- Black soldiers fought bravely in WWII
- Civil rights leaders pushed for change
- A. Philip Randolph threatened huge protest
- Truman believed it was morally right
- Needed more soldiers for Cold War

3. Implementation:
- Army resisted at first (ㅠㅠ)
- Korean War speed up the process (우리나라가 도왔어요!)
- By 1954, last segregated unit was gone
- First major American institution to desegregate

4. Results:
- Helped launch Civil Rights Movement
- Proved integration could work
- Created opportunities for Black Americans
- Changed military culture

This really showed how the military could lead social change, oppa! (◠‿◠)
