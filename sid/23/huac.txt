Okay oppa, now we have HUAC - the House Un-American Activities Committee! (°ロ°) This one's pretty intense!

HUAC (1938-1975):

1. What It Was:
- Special committee in Congress
- Investigated "un-American" activities
- Looked for communist influence
- Super powerful during Cold War years

2. Famous Investigations:
- Hollywood movie industry (헐!)
- Led to Hollywood Blacklist
- Labor unions
- Civil rights groups
- Many artists and writers

3. Key Methods:
- Public hearings (like scary TV shows!)
- Made people name other "communists"
- Asked "Are you now or have you ever been a Communist?"
- Could send people to jail for not answering

4. Famous Cases:
- Hollywood Ten (writers/directors who went to jail)
- Alger Hiss case
- Pete Seeger (famous singer!)
