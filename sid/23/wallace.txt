Let's learn about Henry Wallace, oppa! (◕ᴗ◕✿) He was Truman's opposite in many ways!

Henry Wallace:

1. Background:
- Former Vice President (FDR's third term)
- Former Secretary of Agriculture
- Progressive Party candidate 1948
- Really different ideas! (특별했어요!)
- Too liberal for many people

2. His Views:
- Wanted friendship with USSR
- Against Cold War policies
- Supported labor unions
- Pro civil rights
- Anti-colonialism
- Very progressive! (너무 앞서갔나봐요...)

3. 1948 Campaign:
- Ran as third party
- Called for peace with Soviets
- Supported universal healthcare
- Wanted to end segregation
- Got only 2.4% of votes (아쉽다...)

4. Legacy:
- Called naive about Soviets
- Some ideas came true later
- Influenced later progressives
- Showed limits of leftist politics
- Important peace voice

He was kind of ahead of his time, don't you think oppa? (。⌒∇⌒)。
