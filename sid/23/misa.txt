Okay oppa, let's look at the McCarran Internal Security Act! (◕ᴗ◕✿)

McCarran Internal Security Act (1950):

1. Main Points:
- Required communist organizations to register with government
- Created control board to investigate communists
- Let government arrest suspected spies during emergencies
- Made it harder for former communists to get passports
- Passed over Truman's veto! (대박!)

2. Key Requirements:
- Communist groups had to:
  * List all members
  * Report all money
  * Label propaganda as communist
  * Register with Justice Department

3. New Rules:
- No communists in defense jobs
- Could detain suspected subversives
- Stricter immigration controls
- Limited who could enter US

4. Results:
- Supreme Court later ruled parts unconstitutional
- Created lots of fear
- Made immigration stricter
- Some say it went against civil liberties (너무 심했어요...)

This shows how scared America was of communism, oppa! (；′⌒`)
