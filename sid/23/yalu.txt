Now we have the Yalu River incident, oppa! (◎_◎;) This was a super important moment in the Korean War!

Yalu River (1950):

1. What Happened:
- UN forces approached Yalu River (압록강)
- This river borders China and Korea
- MacArthur wanted to cross it
- China warned not to come near (경고했어요!)
- Led to Chinese entering war

2. MacArthur's Actions:
- Ignored Chinese warnings
- Promised troops "home by Christmas"
- Bombed bridges on Yalu
- Underestimated Chinese threat
- Made big mistake! (큰 실수였어요...)

3. Results:
- Chinese sent 300,000 troops! (헐!)
- UN forces had to retreat
- Longest retreat in US military history
- Changed whole course of war
- Led to MacArthur's firing later

4. Impact:
- Made war much longer
- Changed from victory to stalemate
- Showed dangers of ignoring China
- Affected US-China relations for years

This really shows how one decision can change everything, oppa! (；′⌒`)
