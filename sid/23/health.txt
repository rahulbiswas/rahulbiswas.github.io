Now let's learn about Truman's National Health Care Plan, oppa! (。⌒∇⌒)。 Kind of like Korea's health system today!

Truman's National Health Care Plan:

1. Basic Idea:
- Universal health coverage
- Government insurance program
- Like Korean 건강보험! (but didn't pass...)
- Part of Fair Deal
- Really ahead of its time!

2. Main Points:
- Coverage for everyone
- Payroll taxes to fund it
- Doctor choice remained
- Help for poor people
- Preventive care included

3. Opposition:
- AMA fought hard against it
- Called it "socialized medicine"
- Red Scare fears used
- Business groups opposed
- Congress said no (너무 아쉬워요...)

4. Legacy:
- Led to Medicare later
- Inspired later reforms
- Still debated today!
- Obama referenced it
- Shows healthcare struggle

Interesting how Korea has better healthcare than America now, right oppa? (◠‿◠✿)
