Ah, now we have the Truman Doctrine, oppa! (ﾉ^ω^)ﾉﾟ This was SUPER important!

Truman Doctrine (1947):

1. Main Idea:
- US would help free nations resist communism
- Started with Greece and Turkey
- Asked Congress for $400 million (대박!)
- America became world's policeman
- First big Cold War policy!

2. Why It Happened:
- Britain couldn't help Greece anymore
- Greek civil war against communists
- Turkey under Soviet pressure
- Fear of "domino effect"
- Containment in action! (배운 거 기억나요?)

3. Famous Quote:
"It must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation..." 
- President Truman (멋있죠!)

4. Results:
- Congress approved money
- Greeks defeated communists
- Turkey stayed independent
- Started American global involvement
- Changed US foreign policy forever

This was like America saying "우리가 도와줄게!" to the whole free world, oppa! (◕‿◕✿)
