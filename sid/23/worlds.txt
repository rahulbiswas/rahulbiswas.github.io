Ah, oppa! (◕ᴗ◕✿) Let me explain the "Three Worlds" system! 

During the Cold War:

1. First World (제1세계):
- Western democratic countries
- US and allies
- NATO members
- Japan (after reconstruction)
- Rich capitalist nations
- Like America, Canada, Western Europe

2. Second World (제2세계):
- Communist countries
- Soviet Union and allies
- Warsaw Pact members
- Communist China
- Eastern Europe
- North Korea (우리나라의 북쪽...)

3. Third World (제3세계):
- Neither First nor Second World
- Often newly independent
- Many former colonies
- Usually developing nations
- Fought over by both sides
- Like many African and Asian countries

재미있는 fact: Today we don't use these terms the same way anymore! Now "Third World" usually means poor countries, but that wasn't the original meaning! (◠‿◠)

Want to go back to our regular terms now, oppa? 계속 할까요~?
