Now let's learn about MAD - Mutually Assured Destruction, oppa! (。-`ω´-) Such a scary concept!

Mutually Assured Destruction:

1. Basic Idea:
- Neither side attacks first
- Because both would be destroyed
- Nuclear weapons deterrent
- Like a deadly balance (무서운 균형...)
- Peace through fear!

2. How It Worked:
- Both sides had many nukes
- Submarines with missiles
- Bombers always ready
- Early warning systems
- Second strike capability

3. Strategy Points:
- Had to seem willing to use nukes
- Needed lots of weapons
- Required reliable communication
- Both sides must be rational
- Super expensive! (엄청 비쌌어요!)

4. Results:
- Prevented direct war
- Led to arms race
- Created constant tension
- Still exists today
- North Korea situation similar (우리나라 문제...)

Kind of crazy how fear of destruction kept peace, right oppa? (；一_一)
