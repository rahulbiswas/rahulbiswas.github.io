# Day 1: Understanding the MAZE Grid

## Goal
Today we'll learn how the MAZE grid works and how to access information in it.

## What You'll Learn
- How 2D arrays work in JavaScript
- How to access specific positions in a grid
- How the grid relates to our game board

## Instructions

1. **Add the MAZE array to your code**
   ```javascript
   const MAZE = [
       [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
   ];
   ```

2. **Add these console.log statements to your code**
   ```javascript
   // Add these after your MAZE definition
   console.log("What's at the top-left corner?", MAZE[0][0]);
   console.log("What's one step in from the corner?", MAZE[1][1]);
   console.log("What's in the middle of the maze?", MAZE[10][10]);
   
   // Look at a whole row
   console.log("The first row of the maze:", MAZE[0]);
   
   // Look at specific positions
   console.log("Position [5][5]:", MAZE[5][5]);
   console.log("Position [0][5]:", MAZE[0][5]);
   
   // Count how many 1s are in the first row
   let wallCount = 0;
   for (let i = 0; i < MAZE[0].length; i++) {
       if (MAZE[0][i] === 1) {
           wallCount++;
       }
   }
   console.log("Number of walls in the first row:", wallCount);
   ```

3. **Open your browser console**
   * Right-click on your game page and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"
   * Click on the "Console" tab
   * You should see the results of your console.log statements

4. **Try changing some values in the MAZE array**
   * Change `MAZE[5][5] = 1` and see what the console shows
   * Try other positions too!

## Experiment on Your Own

Try these experiments and use console.log to see what happens:

```javascript
// What happens if we change this value?
MAZE[3][3] = 1;
console.log("Position [3][3] is now:", MAZE[3][3]);

// How do we check if a position is a wall?
const isWall = MAZE[1][1] === 1;
console.log("Is position [1][1] a wall?", isWall);

// How do we count walls in the whole maze?
let totalWalls = 0;
for (let x = 0; x < MAZE.length; x++) {
    for (let y = 0; y < MAZE[x].length; y++) {
        if (MAZE[x][y] === 1) {
            totalWalls++;
        }
    }
}
console.log("Total walls in the maze:", totalWalls);
```

## Remember
- In MAZE[x][y], x is the row and y is the column
- 1 means "wall" and 0 means "empty space"
- We'll use this MAZE grid tomorrow to draw our walls!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
