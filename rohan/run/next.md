# More Pellets: Filling the Maze

## Today's Goal
Let's fill all the empty spaces in our maze with pellets, just like classic Pac-Man! 

## The Plan
Modify addSomePellets() to fill all empty spaces:
- Loop through the maze
- Add pellets (1) wherever there's an empty space (0)
- Skip walls (they stay as 1 in MAZE)

힌트: Remember to initialize the pellets array first before filling it! 화이팅!
